<h1>Writing ScalaCheck-style properties</h1>

<p>
ScalaTest supports two styles of property-based testing: ScalaTest style and ScalaCheck style. Both approaches use ScalaCheck to actually check properties
when tests are run. This page describes the ScalaCheck style.
(For information on the tradeoffs of each style, see the <a href="#selectingAStyle">Selecting a property-based testing style</a> section below.) 
</p>

<p>
To write properties in the ScalaCheck style, mix in trait <a href='@scaladocsPageUrl("org.scalatest.prop.Checkers")'><code>Checkers</code></a> or
import the members of its <a href='@scaladocsPageUrl("org.scalatest.prop.Checkers$")'>companion object</a>. Trait <code>Checkers</code>
contains several <code>check</code> methods that perform ScalaCheck property checks. If ScalaCheck finds a test case for which a property doesn't
hold, the problem will be reported as a ScalaTest test failure.
</p>

<p>
To use ScalaCheck, you specify properties and, in some cases, generators that generate test data. You need not always
create generators, because ScalaCheck provides many default generators for you that can be used in many situations.
ScalaCheck will use the generators to generate test data and with that data run tests that check that the property holds.
Property-based tests can, therefore, give you a lot more testing for a lot less code than assertion-based tests.
Here's an example of using ScalaCheck from a <code>JUnitSuite</code>:
</p>
<pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">import</span> org.scalatest.junit.JUnitSuite
<span class="stReserved">import</span> org.scalatest.prop.Checkers
<span class="stReserved">import</span> org.scalacheck.Arbitrary._
<span class="stReserved">import</span> org.scalacheck.Prop._
<br /><span class="stReserved">class</span> <span class="stType">MySuite</span> <span class="stReserved">extends</span> <span class="stType">JUnitSuite</span> <span class="stReserved">with</span> <span class="stType">Checkers</span> {
  &#64;<span class="stType">Test</span>
  <span class="stReserved">def</span> testConcat() {
    check((a: <span class="stType">List[Int]</span>, b: <span class="stType">List[Int]</span>) =&gt; a.size + b.size == (a ::: b).size)
  }
}
</pre>
<p>
The <code>check</code> method, defined in <code>Checkers</code>, makes it easy to write property-based tests inside
ScalaTest, JUnit, and TestNG test suites. This example specifies a property that <code>List</code>'s <code>:::</code> method
should obey. ScalaCheck properties are expressed as function values that take the required
test data as parameters. ScalaCheck will generate test data using generators and 
repeatedly pass generated data to the function. In this case, the test data is composed of integer lists named <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.
Inside the body of the function, you see:
</p>
<pre class="stHighlighted">
a.size + b.size == (a ::: b).size
</pre>
<p>
The property in this case is a <code>Boolean</code> expression that will yield true if the size of the concatenated list is equal
to the size of each individual list added together. With this small amount
of code, ScalaCheck will generate possibly hundreds of value pairs for <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> and test each pair, looking for
a pair of integers for which the property doesn't hold. If the property holds true for every value ScalaCheck tries,
<code>check</code> returns normally. Otherwise, <code>check</code> will complete abruptly with a <code>TestFailedException</code> that
contains information about the failure, including the values that cause the property to be false.
</p>

<p>
For more information on using ScalaCheck properties, see the documentation for ScalaCheck, which is available
from <a href="http://code.google.com/p/scalacheck/">http://code.google.com/p/scalacheck/</a>.
</p>

<p>
To execute a suite that mixes in <code>Checkers</code> with ScalaTest's <code>Runner</code>, you must include ScalaCheck's jar file on the class path or runpath.
</p>

<a name="propCheckConfig"></a><h2>Property check configuration</h2>

<p>
The property checks performed by the <code>check</code> methods of this trait can be flexibly configured via the services
provided by supertrait <code>Configuration</code>.  The five configuration parameters for property checks along with their
default values and meanings are described in the following table:

<p>
The <code>check</code> methods of trait <code>Checkers</code> each take a <code>PropertyCheckConfig</code>
object as an implicit parameter. This object provides values for each of the five configuration parameters. Trait <code>Configuration</code>
provides an implicit <code>val</code> named <code>generatorDrivenConfig</code> with each configuration parameter set to its default value.
If you want to set one or more configuration parameters to a different value for all property checks in a suite you can override this
val (or hide it, for example, if you are importing the members of the <code>Checkers</code> companion object rather
than mixing in the trait.) For example, if
you want all parameters at their defaults except for <code>minSize</code> and <code>maxSize</code>, you can override
<code>generatorDrivenConfig</code>, like this:

<pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">implicit</span> <span class="stReserved">override</span> <span class="stReserved">val</span> generatorDrivenConfig =
  <span class="stType">PropertyCheckConfig</span>(minSize = <span class="stLiteral">10</span>, maxSize = <span class="stLiteral">20</span>)
</pre>

<p>
Or, if hide it by declaring a variable of the same name in whatever scope you want the changed values to be in effect:
</p>

<pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">implicit</span> <span class="stReserved">val</span> generatorDrivenConfig =
  <span class="stType">PropertyCheckConfig</span>(minSize = <span class="stLiteral">10</span>, maxSize = <span class="stLiteral">20</span>)
</pre>

<p>
In addition to taking a <code>PropertyCheckConfig</code> object as an implicit parameter, the <code>check</code> methods of trait
<code>Checkers</code> also take a variable length argument list of <code>PropertyCheckConfigParam</code>
objects that you can use to override the values provided by the implicit <code>PropertyCheckConfig</code> for a single <code>check</code>
invocation. You place these configuration settings after the property or property function, For example, if you want to
set <code>minSuccessful</code> to 500 for just one particular <code>check</code> invocation,
you can do so like this:
</p>

<pre class="stHighlighted">
check((n: <span class="stType">Int</span>) => n + <span class="stLiteral">0</span> == n, minSuccessful(<span class="stLiteral">500</span>))
</pre>

<p>
This invocation of <code>check</code> will use 500 for <code>minSuccessful</code> and whatever values are specified by the
implicitly passed <code>PropertyCheckConfig</code> object for the other configuration parameters.
If you want to set multiple configuration parameters in this way, just list them separated by commas:
</p>

<pre class="stHighlighted">
check((n: <span class="stType">Int</span>) => n + <span class="stLiteral">0</span> == n, minSuccessful(<span class="stLiteral">500</span>), maxDiscarded(<span class="stLiteral">300</span>))
</pre>

<p>
The previous configuration approach works the same in <code>Checkers</code> as it does in <code>GeneratorDrivenPropertyChecks</code>.
Trait <code>Checkers</code> also provides one <code>check</code> method that takes an <code>org.scalacheck.Test.Params</code> object,
in case you want to configure ScalaCheck that way.
</p>

<pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">import</span> org.scalacheck.Prop
<span class="stReserved">import</span> org.scalacheck.Test.Params
<span class="stReserved">import</span> org.scalatest.prop.Checkers._
<br />check(Prop.forAll((n: <span class="stType">Int</span>) => n + <span class="stLiteral">0</span> == n), <span class="stType">Params</span>(minSuccessfulTests = <span class="stLiteral">5</span>))
</pre>

<a name="selectingAStyle"></a><h2>Selecting a property-based testing style</h2>

<p>
For the ScalaTest style, you mix in 
trait <a href='@scaladocsPageUrl("org.scalatest.prop.GeneratorDrivenPropertyChecks")'><code>GeneratorDrivenPropertyChecks</code></a> and
express properties with <code>whenever</code> clauses and matcher expressions. For the ScalaCheck style, you mix in trait
<a href='@scaladocsPageUrl("org.scalatest.prop.Checkers")'><code>Checkers</code></a> and
express properties as boolean expressions, using ScalaCheck's native operators such as <code>==&gt;</code>, <code>:|</code>, <code>|:</code>, and so on, as
needed.  The purpose of the ScalaTest style is to make property-based
testing more consistent with the other styles of testing that ScalaTest supports.
</p>

<p>
<code>GeneratorDrivenPropertyChecks</code> is an alternative to <code>Checkers</code>. Both are essentially front-ends to ScalaCheck, and both require that ScalaCheck's jar file be on the class path. The difference is <code>Checkers</code> facilitates the traditional ScalaCheck style of writing properties, whereas <code>GeneratorDrivenPropertyChecks</code> facilitates a ScalaTest style of writing properties that takes advantage of ScalaTest's assertions and matchers. To see the difference, consider an example written in each style. With <code>Checkers</code> you'd usually write a property function like this:
</p>

<pre>
check { (n: Int) =>
  n > 1 ==> n / 2 > 0
}
</pre>

<p>
This is the native ScalaCheck style: you write a function that takes some data, then use that data in a boolean expression, returning the result. If the property is only valid for a subset of the full range of values of the types being passed (for example, in this case the expression only makes sense for integers greater than one), you would use the implication operator <code>==></code>. The code, <code>n > 1 ==></code> in front of <code>n / 2 > 0</code>  essentially means that whenever <code>n > 1</code>, <code>n / 2</code> should be greater than <code>0</code>. In the ScalaTest property style you use the word <code>whenever</code> instead of <code>==></code> and either an assertion or matcher expression instead of a boolean expression:
</p>

<pre>
forAll { (n: Int) =>
  whenever (n > 1) { n / 2 should be > 0 }
}
</pre>

<p>
The two main goals I have for providing a ScalaTest style of writing properties are consistency and clarity. By allowing people to write properties similarly to how they write regular unit test, I'm hoping it will make property-based tests easier to write and read, and thereby make property-based testing more accessible to the many programmers who have never seen it before. That's the consistency.
</p>

<p>
Clarity is a general goal I have when I make design decisions for ScalaTest. When someone looks at some ScalaTest code written by someone else, to the extent possible I want them to be able to understand the intent of the programmer without having to look anything up in the ScalaTest documentation. I want it to be plainly obvious. The <code>==></code> operator does not pass that test, but <code>whenever</code> does. Also I think readers may find it hard to parse properties where <code>=></code> is near <code>==></code> because they look so similar. Moreover, things can get harder to read with the traditional ScalaCheck style when properties get more complex. Here's a <code>Checkers</code> example inspired by code in the ScalaCheck documentation describing ScalaCheck labels:
</p>

<pre>
def myMagicFunction(n: Int, m: Int) = n + m

check { (m: Int, n: Int) =>
  val res = myMagicFunction(n, m)
  (res >= m)    :| "result > #1" &&
  (res >= n)    :| "result > #2" &&
  (res < m + n) :| "result not sum"
}
</pre>

<p>
Like <code>==></code>, the <code>:|</code> operator doesn't pass the test of not needing to look things up in the documentation. What <code>:|</code> (and its cousin, <code>|:</code>) does is attach a string label to a part of the boolean expression. That way if a complex property fails, you can more easily figure out which part of the expression caused the failure. When you check the above labeled property it will fail with arguments (0, 0) and indicate the label of the failing part was <code>"result not sum"</code>.
</p>

<p>
By contrast, the equivalent property in the ScalaTest style might look like this:
</p>

<pre>
forAll { (m: Int, n: Int) =>
  val res = myMagicFunction(n, m)
  res should be >= m
  res should be >= n
  res should be < m + n
}
</pre>

<p>
I think this style is easier to both write and read. When it fails, it tells you the failing arguments were (0, 0), gives you a failure message that reads, "<code>0 was not less than 0</code>," and provides the line number of the failing expression, which is <code>res should be < m + n</code>. Alternatively, you could write it this way:
</p>


<pre>
forAll { (m: Int, n: Int) =>                  
  val res = myMagicFunction(n, m)
  res should (be >= m and be >= n and be < m + n)
}
</pre>

<p>
This form would also fail indicating the args were (0, 0), giving the line number of the offending matcher expression and failure message that reads, "<code>0 was greater than or equal to 0, and 0 was greater than or equal to 0, but 0 was not less than 0</code>." So either way you write this property in ScalaTest style, it is pretty easy to figure out what went wrong, and you figure it out the same way you would for regular (non-property-based) tests.
</p>
