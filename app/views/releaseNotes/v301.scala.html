        <h1>ScalaTest/Scalactic 3.0.1 Release Notes</h1>

        <p>
            ScalaTest/Scalactic 3.0.1 includes the enhancements and bug fixes listed below. No source code using
            ScalaTest/Scalactic 3.0 or higher should break, but from any version other than other 3.0.x releases (with which this release is binary
            compatible), you will likely need to do a clean build to upgrade.
        </p>

        <p>
            For information on how to include ScalaTest in your project, see the <a href="/install">install page</a>.
            For information on how to use <a href="http://www.scalactic.org/">Scalactic</a> in your production code,
            see its <a href="http://www.scalactic.org/install">install page</a>.

        <h2>Enhancements</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Unregister the reporter to free up memory when <code>completedTests</code> is called in <code>SuiteSortingReporter</code></li>
            <li>Changed the <code>Position.default</code> macro so that it only includes the file pathname in the resulting <code>Position</code>
             if the environment variable <code>SCALACTIC_FILE_PATHNAMES</code> is set to true, so that the default behavior is to
             create reproducible test binaries.</li>
            <li>Updated the ScalaCheck dependency to version 1.13.4.</li>
            <li>Updated the Scala-js dependency to version 0.6.13.</li>
