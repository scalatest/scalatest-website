<h1>ScalaTest/Scalactic 2.2.1 Release Notes</h1>

<p>
ScalaTest/Scalactic 2.2.1 includes the enhancements and bug fixes listed below. No source code using
ScalaTest/ScalaUtils 2.0 or higher should break, but from any version other than 2.2.0 (with which this release is binary
compatible), you will likely need to do a clean build to upgrade.
