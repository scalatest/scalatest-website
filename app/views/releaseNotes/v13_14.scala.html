<h1>ScalaTest Release Notes</h1>

<a name="release141"></a>
<h2>Changes in 1.4.1 (for Scala 2.9.x)</h2>

<p>
The goal of the 1.4.1 release is to provide a smooth transition to Scala 2.9.0 for ScalaTest users. It is identical
to 1.3 except for changes required to get it to compile as 1.4.1 under Scala 2.9.0, plus one bug fix to the build to ensure
the Java portions are cross-compiled for JDK 1.5.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Changed the ScalaTest 1.3 build file to ensure the parts of ScalaTest 1.4.1 written in Java (only two classes) get cross-compiled
for JDK 1.5. (This bug fix will also soon be released as ScalaTest 1.3.1. Those two Java classes were accidentally
compiled for JDK 1.6 in ScalaTest 1.3.)</li>
<li>Renamed 1.3 to 1.4.1.</li>
<li>Updated the Scala library and compiler to 2.9.0, and the ScalaCheck JAR file to version 1.8 compiled with Scala 2.9.0.</li>
<li>Added the Scala version number to the artifact ID. <em>I.e.</em>, the artifact ID for ScalaTest 1.4.1 is <code>scalatest_2.9.0</code>
instead of plain old <code>scalatest</code>.</li>
<li>Recompiled 1.3 to run under 1.4.1.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note: What happened to 1.4 you ask? We were given an early access release of Scala 2.9.0, so that ScalaTest could be recompiled for it
early. We quietly deployed 1.4 so that other projects could be built prior to the official announcement that Scala 2.9.0 was ready. We didn't
announce it, but nevertheless someone could have run across it and downloaded it. One day later, we got a brand new Scala 2.9.0. They  had
fixed a couple show-stopper bugs. We needed to redeploy, so we bumped the version number up to 1.4.1 in case someone had found 1.4 in the
meantime. That 1.4 release was then removed from scala-tools.org.

<h2>Changes in 1.3 (for Scala 2.8.x)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Improved the sbt support provided by <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.3")org/scalatest/tools/ScalaTestFramework.html"><code>ScalaTestFramework</code></a> by allowing the formatted
output generated by specification-style traits like <code>Spec</code> or <code>WordSpec</code> to be seen by the
user when running through sbt. Also enable color output.</li> 
<li>Fixed a bug when running suites concurrently that usually manifested itself as an  eventual out of memory error. The
problem was the executor service being used wasn't being shutdown after each use. So if repeated runs were done in the same JVM,
eventually too meany threads would pile up.</li>
<li>Added a <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.3")org/scalatest/SeveredStackTraces.html"><code>SeveredStackTraces</code></a> stack traces trait that violently chops off test-related stack traces just above the 
offending line of test code. Although ScalaTest's exception types provide sufficient information to do this when presenting a
stack trace to the user, some tools (such as IDEs that run ScalaTest via JUnit) don't use this information yet and therefore show
the full stack trace. <code>SeveredStackTraces</code> can be helpful until such tools provide better support for
ScalaTest.</li>
<li>Added traits <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.3")org/scalatest/BeforeAndAfterEachFunctions.html"><code>BeforeAndAfterEachFunctions</code></a> and <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.3")org/scalatest/BeforeAndAfterAllFunctions.html"><code>BeforeAndAfterAllFunctions</code></a>, which offer a more concise form
of before and after functionality (but which can't be stacked or provide access to a config map).</li>
<li>Updated the version of EasyMock to EasyMock 3.0. Unfortuately, EasyMock 3.0 breaks compatibility with previous versions of EasyMock by
moving very important types to new packages. So if you're using EasyMock with ScalaTest, you'll need to upgrade to EasyMock 3.0 to use
ScalaTest 1.3.</li>
<li>Updated the version of ScalaCheck to 1.8. If you're using ScalaTest with ScalaCheck, you'll likely need to upgrade to ScalaCheck 1.8 to use
ScalaTest 1.3.</li>
<li>Added documentation explaining that because <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.3")org/scalatest/concurrent/Conductor.html"><code>Conductor</code></a> uses the result of calling <code>thread.getState</code> for control flow,
occasionally <code>Conductor</code> can produce incorrect results.</li>
<li>Now only use as tags on <code>Suite</code> annotations that are themselves annotated with <code>org.scalatest.TagAnnotation</code>. This
is a breaking change that was marked as deprecated since 1.0, and the deprecation cycle has ended.</li>
<li>Added <code>withClue</code> to <code>Assertions</code> to provide a way to supply extra information in an exception thrown by <code>intercept</code>
or a ScalaTest matcher expression.</li>
<li>Made <code>assert(a1 === a2)</code> compare arrays structurally. In matcher expressions, the <code>===</code> operator means equality in terms
of invoking <code>==</code>, except for arrays, for which <code>==</code> checks that the two arrays are the same instance. For arrays, ScalaTest 
matchers passes the two arrays to <code>java.util.Arrays.deepEquals</code>. Now <code>===</code> has the same behavior for arrays when used in
an assertion. As a result, the <code>===</code> operator now always compares arrays structurally no matter how it is used in ScalaTest. Note, this
change would break any code that was intentionally using <code>===</code> to ensure two arrays are the same instance in an <code>assert</code>. It is 
likely no one was actually doing that, but if so, this will show up as a failed test and that code will need to be
changed to <code>assert(a1 eq a2)</code>. (Sorry, there was no way to deprecate a particular use of <code>===</code>.)</li>
</ul>
