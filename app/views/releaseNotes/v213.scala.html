        <h1>ScalaTest 2.1.3 Release Notes</h1>

        <p>
            ScalaTest 2.1.3 is a maintenance release for the 2.1.x series that includes five enhancements and a bug fix.  No source code using
ScalaTest 2.0+ should break, but you will likely need to do a clean build to upgrade from 2.0.
However, 2.1.3 is binary compatible with 2.1.0, 2.1.1, and 2.1.2, so you can just change the version number in
your build to upgrade from earlier 2.1.x releases.
        </p>

        <a name="enhancements"></a>
        <h2>Enhancements</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Enhanced <code>Prettifier.default</code> to handle <code>scala.xml.NodeSeq</code> and <code>scala.xml.NodeBuffer</code>.</li>
            <li>Enhanced <code>Prettifier.default</code> to handle object that has class type <code>Fred extends Seq[Fred]</code>.</li>
            <li>Refactored <code>Prettifier.default</code> to use <code>stringPrefix</code> for better performance.</li>
            <li>Added <code>-t</code> argument support to sbt integration.</li>
            <li>Disallow any suffix for <code>Runner</code> command line arguments that do not take a suffix. This will give a better error message if someone enters <code>-z"database"</code> instead of <code>-z "database"</code>.</li>
        </ul>

        <a name="bugFixes"></a>
        <h2>Bug fixes</h2>

        <ul>
