<h1>ScalaTest Release Notes</h1>

<a name="release18"></a>

<p>
ScalaTest 1.8 is source (but not necessarily binary) compatible with previous releases. To upgrade from 1.7.1 or 1.7.2, you should only
need to do a clean build.
</p>

<p>
This release includes the following enhancements, bug fixes, dependency changes, and deprecations: 
</p>

<p>
<em>Enhancements:</em>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Added trait <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.path.FunSpec"><code>path.FunSpec</code></a>, a sister trait to <code>org.scalatest.FunSpec</code> that isolates tests by running each test in its own instance of the test class, and for each test, only executing the path leading to that test.</li>
<li>Added trait <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.path.FreeSpec"><code>path.FreeSpec</code></a>, a sister trait to <code>org.scalatest.FreeSpec</code> that isolates tests by running each test in its own instance of the test class, and for each test, only executing the path leading to that test.</li>
<li>Added trait <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.ConfigMapWrapperSuite"><code>ConfigMapWrapperSuite</code></a>, a wrapper <code>Suite</code> that passes an instance of the config map to the constructor of the wrapped <code>Suite</code> when run is invoked.</li>
<li>Added trait <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.concurrent.Eventually"><code>Eventually</code></a>, which provides an
<code>eventually</code> construct that periodically retries executing a passed by-name parameter until it either succeeds or the configured timeout has been surpassed.</li>
<li>Added trait <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.concurrent.AsyncAssertions"><code>AsyncAssertions</code></a>, which facilitates performing
assertions outside the main test thread, such as assertions in callback methods that are invoked asynchronously. Trait <code>AsyncAssertions</code> provides a
<code>Waiter</code> class that you can use to orchestrate the inter-thread communication required to perform assertions outside the main test thread, and means
to configure it.</li>
<li>Added trait <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.concurrent.Timeouts"><code>Timeouts</code></a>, which provides a
<code>failAfter</code> construct that allows you to specify a time limit for an operation passed as a by-name parameter, as well as a way to interrupt it if the operation
exceeds its time limit.</li>
<li>Added trait <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.concurrent.TimeLimitedTests"><code>TimeLimitedTests</code></a>, which, when mixed into a suite class, establishes a time limit for its tests.</li>
<li>Added trait <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.concurrent.Interruptor"><code>Interruptor</code></a>, an abstract interface defining a strategy for interrupting an operation after a timeout expires (<code>Interruptor</code>s are used by traits <code>Timeouts</code> and <code>TimeLimitedTests</code>.). Provided four built-in implementations: <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.concurrent.DoNotInterrupt$"><code>DoNotInterrupt</code></a>, <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.concurrent.SelectorInterruptor"><code>SelectorInterruptor</code></a>, <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.concurrent.SocketInterruptor"><code>SocketInterruptor</code></a>, <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.concurrent.ThreadInterruptor$"><code>ThreadInterruptor</code></a>.</li>
<li>Added an <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.time.package"><code>org.scalatest.time</code></a> package containing class <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.time.Span"><code>Span</code></a>, used to express time spans in ScalaTest (<code>Span</code> is used by several traits in <code>org.scalatest.concurrent</code>), trait <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.time.SpanSugar"><code>SpanSugar</code></a>, and several other <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.time.package">supporting classes and objects</a>.</li>
<li>Added trait <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.concurrent.ScaledTimeSpans"><code>ScaledTimeSpans</code></a>, which provides a <code>scaled</code> method that will scale a <code>Span</code> larger or smaller by a <code>Double</code> factor taken from a sister method, <code>spanScaleFactor</code>. Added a <code>-F</code>
argument to <code>Runner</code> for specifying the span scale factor (and corresponding commands for sbt and ant).</li>
<li>Added trait <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.concurrent.PatienceConfiguration"><code>PatienceConfiguration</code></a>, which provides methods and classes used to configure timeouts and, where relevant, the interval between retries.</li>
<li>Added trait <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.concurrent.IntegrationPatience"><code>IntegrationPatience</code></a>, which overrides the implicit <code>PatienceConfig</code> object providing default values appropriate for unit testing (150 millisecond timeout and 15 millisecond interval) with one more appropriate for integration testing (15 second timeout and 150 millisecond interval). </li>
<li>Added trait <code><a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.concurrent.Conductors">Conductors</a></code>, moved a copy of <code>Conductor</code> there,
and made changes so that <code>Conductor</code> is configured in a manner consistent with <code>Eventually</code> and <code>AsyncAssertions</code>.</li>
<li>Moved most exception classes and traits to their own package, <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.exceptions.package"><code>org.scalatest.exceptions</code></a>, and left deprecated type aliases in place of their old names. This change was done to declutter their former homes, so it is easier for users
to focus on the classes and traits they are more likely to use day to day.</li>
<li>Added class <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.exceptions.TestFailedDueToTimeoutException"><code>TestFailedDueToTimeoutException</code></a>,
a subclass of <code>TestFailedException</code> thrown by the <code>failAfter</code> method of trait <code>Timeouts</code> if it times out.</li>
<li>Added trait <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.exceptions.TimeoutField"><code>TimeoutField</code></a>, a trait mixed into exceptions
thrown as the result of a timeout.</li>
<li>Added trait <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.exceptions.PayloadField"><code>PayloadField</code></a>, a trait mixed into exceptions
that can carry a payload (an arbitrary object that will be fired in the corresponding ScalaTest event, so it can be consumed by custom reporters). Had to add payload
to the primary constructor of several existing exception types. Left the old form in place as an auxiliary constructor so existing code would continue to work.</li>
<li>Added trait <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.exceptions.ModifiablePayload"><code>ModifiablePayload</code></a>, which indicates a <code>PayloadField</code> exception type can modify its payload.</li>
<li>Added trait <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.Payloads"><code>Payloads</code></a>, which facilitates the inclusion of a payload in a thrown ScalaTest exception, so that payload object can be included in a corresponding ScalaTest event and interpreted by custom reporters.</li>

<li>Added a second parameter to the <code>apply</code> method of trait <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.Informer"><code>Informer</code></a>,
to facilitate the inclusion of a payload in an <code>InfoProvided</code> event. The parameter has type <code>Option[Any]</code> with a default value of <code>None</code>,
so old code will continute to work.</li>

<li>Gave the <code>withClue</code> construct in <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.Assertions"><code>Assertions</code></a> a result type, so it would pass through any
value in case someone wanted that. Previously it was <code>Unit</code>.</li>
<li>Added trait <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.AppendedClues"><code>AppendedClues</code></a>, which provides an implicit conversion that places a <code>withClue</code> method on <code>Any</code>, enabling clue strings to be placed <em>after</em> a block of code that may throw an exception. This construct
complements the <code>withClue</code> construct provided in trait <code>Assertions</code> that allows clue strings to be placed <em>before</em> a block of code.</li>
<li>Dropped explicit mention of <code>java.awt.AWTError</code> to facilitate running ScalaTest on Android. ScalaTest will continue to treat <code>java.awt.AWTError</code>s
in the same way: they cause the suite to abort rather than the test to fail, but checking is now done based on the string class name to avoid the explicit reference that
caused problems on Android.</li>
<li>Reimplemented the <code>run</code> method in the <code>org.scalatest</code> package object as an <code>apply</code> method in an
<a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.run$"><code>org.scalatest.run</code></a> singleton
object. The client code and behavior are the same, but this implementation enabled the addition of a <code>main</code> method as well that provides the "simple runner".</li>
<li>Added a <em>simple runner</em> implemented as a <code>main</code> method on the new
<a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.run$"><code>org.scalatest.run</code></a> singleton object. This application provides
a better out-of-box experience for users getting started with ScalaTest, and an easier to remember way to run tests from the command line for experienced ScalaTest users.</li>
<li>Added support to ScalaTest for specifying <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.tools.Runner$@@specifyingChosenStyles">chosen
styles</a>, to help enforce uniformity of testing styles on projects built by teams of developers. You can now specify chosen styles with <code>-y</code> argument
to <code>Runner</code>. Added a new lifecycle method to <code>Suite</code>, 
<code>styleName</code> to support this feature. ScalaTest style traits override <code>styleName</code> and return their fully qualified name as a string. If chosen styles is
defined, ScalaTest style traits that are not among the chosen list will abort with a message complaining that the style trait is not one of the chosen styles instead
of running its tests. Chosen styles is also supported by the ScalaTest ant task and <code>ScalaTestFramework</code> (so accessible via sbt). 
</li>
<li>Added ability to specify <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.tools.Runner$@@specifyingSuffixesToDiscover">suffixes to discover</a>, which
can speed up the discovery process on large projects. If you specify suffixes with <code>-q</code>, ScalaTest will only load and inspect class files whose
name ends in the suffix to see if they are runnable <code>Suite</code>s. Also added a <code>-Q</code> option to specify suffixes <code>"Suite|Spec"</code>.
</li>
<li>Added support for using <code>they</code> as an alternative to <code>it</code> in <code>org.scalatest.FlatSpec</code> and <code>org.scalatest.fixture.FlatSpec</code>, <code>org.scalatest.FunSpec</code>, <code>org.scalatest.fixture.FunSpec</code>, and <code>org.scalatest.path.FunSpec</code>. (This enhancement was inspired by a blog post
by Christoph Henkelmann.)</li>
<li>Tweaked the algorithm used to clean up type names in the Scala interpreter, so users aren't pummeled with dollar signs. The old algorithm was broken when Scala
changed its approach to naming in 2.9. Once again you'll see <code>ExampleSpec</code> rather than <code>$read$$iw$$iw$$iw$$iw$ExampleSpec</code>.</li>
<li>Renamed <code>-c</code> to <code>-P</code>, <code>-r</code> to <code>-C</code>, and <code>-p</code> to <code>-R</code> in <code>Runner</code> and
<code>ScalaTestAntTask</code>, and deprecated the old usages. After the deprecation cycle, will deprecate the capital forms in favor of lower case forms.
The goal is to have <code>-p</code> mean parallel execution (currently <code>-c</code>), <code>-c</code> mean custom reporter (currently <code>-r</code>), and
-r</code> mean runpath (currently <code>-p</code>). The new names will be more consistent and hopefully easier to remember.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<em>Bug fixes</em>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed stack depth in several style trait methods for rare problems like <code>TestRegistrationClosedException</code>.</li>
<li>Discovered that <code>GeneratorDrivenPropertyChecks</code> were not reporting the given parameter names if they were
specified in combination with explicit generators passed to <code>forAll</code>. Now they do.</li>
<li>Discovered <code>PropertyCheckException</code>s were not correctly modifying their message if used with <code>withClue</code>. Now they do.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<em>Deprecations</em>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Deprecated <code>org.scalatest.concurrent.Conductor</code> after moving a copy of it to trait <code>Conductors</code>. The purpose of this move was so that
<code>Conductor</code> could be configured via <code>PatienceConfiguration</code> and scaled by <code>ScaledTimeSpans</code>, making it consistent with
traits <code>Eventually</code> and <code>AsyncAssertions</code>. 
<li>Deprecated <code>org.scalatest.concurrent.ConductorMultiFixture</code>, which accidentally escaped deprecation in 1.5 when the other "multi fixture" traits
(in <code>org.scalatest.fixture</code>) were deprecated.</li>
<li>Deprecated <code>org.scalatest.DuplicateTestNameException</code>,  <code>org.scalatest.ModifiableMessage</code>,  <code>org.scalatest.NotAllowedException</code>,  <code>org.scalatest.StackDepth</code>,  <code>org.scalatest.StackDepthException</code>,  <code>org.scalatest.TestFailedException</code>,  <code>org.scalatest.TestPendingException</code>,  <code>org.scalatest.TestRegistrationClosedException</code>,  <code>org.scalatest.prop.DiscardedEvaluationException</code>,  <code>org.scalatest.prop.GeneratorDrivenPropertyCheckFailedException</code>,  <code>org.scalatest.prop.PropertyCheckFailedException</code>,  <code>org.scalatest.prop.TableDrivenPropertyCheckFailedException</code>. These deprecations
were to support moving most exception types to the new <code>org.scalatest.exceptions</code> package. Old code using the old names will continue
to work during the deprecation phase. An <code>org.scalatest.prop</code> package object was created to hold the deprecated type aliases for that package. This
package object will also be removed at the end of the deprecation period (unless it acquires a new, non-deprecated member in the meantime).</li>
<li>Deprecated <code>Runner</code> arguments <code>-r</code>, <code>-c</code>, and <code>-p</code> (and corresponding <code>ScalaTestAntTask</code> syntax)
 in favor of their new names (see the previous Enhancements section).
The old names will continue to work during the deprecation cycle.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<em>Removals</em>
</p>

<ul>
<li>REMOVED support in <code>Runner</code> for <code>-t</code> to run TestNG tests. This use of <code>-t</code> was deprecated in 1.7 and replaced by <code>-b</code>,
because in ScalaTest 2.0 <code>-t</code> will be used to indicate a test name to run. To make sure the ground was clear for this new use
in ScalaTest 2.0, <code>-t</code> will print an error message and abort the run in ScalaTest 1.8. If you haven't already, you'll have to change uses of
<code>-t</code> to <code>-b</code> to upgrade to ScalaTest 1.8.</li>
<li>REMOVED the ability to directly instantiate <code>org.scalatest.exceptions.PropertyCheckException</code> by making it abstract. It was supposed
to be abstract, but as an oversight was left concrete. This is a breaking change that likely will not affect any users.</li>
<li>REMOVED the ability to mix most ScalaTest style traits together in the same class by adding <code>styleName</code> method to <code>AbstractSuite</code> and
overriding and making it final in many style traits. It was never intended that users would mix together core style traits, and likely it wouldn't compile in
many cases anyway. But now for sure it won't compile in most cases.</li>
</ul>
