        <h1>ScalaTest 2.1.5 Release Notes</h1>

        <p>
            ScalaTest 2.1.5 is a maintenance release for the 2.1.x series that includes one bug fix: the addition
of Java annotations for browser drivers that were accidentally left out of the 2.1.4 release. No source code using
ScalaTest 2.0+ should break, but you will likely need to do a clean build to upgrade from 2.0.
However, 2.1.5 is binary compatible with 2.1.0, 2.1.1, and 2.1.2, and 2.1.3, and 2.1.4, so you can just change the version number in
your build to upgrade from earlier 2.1.x releases.
        </p>
