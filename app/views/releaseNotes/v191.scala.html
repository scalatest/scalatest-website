<h1>ScalaTest Release Notes</h1>

<a name="release191"></a>

<p>
ScalaTest 1.9.1 is source (but not necessarily binary) compatible with previous releases. To upgrade from 1.8, you should only
need to do a clean build.
</p>

<p>
This release was created to accomdate changes forced by Scala 2.10 and sbt 0.12. As a result, from the user's perspective
it differs from 1.8 by only one bug fix and two deprecations: 
</p>

<p>
<em>Bug fixes</em>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Added missing abstract and override modifiers for <code>patienceConfig</code> in <code>org.scalatest.concurrent.IntegrationPatience</code> to enable it
to be mixed in as intended.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<em>Deprecations</em>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Added <code>expectResult</code> to <a href="@latestScaladoc/#org.scalatest.Assertions"><code>Assertions</code></a>, and deprecated <code>expect</code>. <code>expect</code> will be used for a different purpose in a future version of ScalaTest.</li>
<li>Renamed <code>Matchers</code> in package <code>org.scalatest.matchers</code> to </code>ClassicMatchers</code> and deprecated <code>Matchers</code>.
</ul>
