        <h1>ScalaTest 2.1.7 Release Notes</h1>

        <p>
            ScalaTest 2.1.7 is a maintenance release for the 2.1.x series that includes the two changes listed below.
No source code using ScalaTest 2.0+ should break, but you may need to do a clean build to upgrade.
Although, 2.1.7 will likely binary compatible for the vast majority of projects using earlier 2.1.x versions, because of a compiler bug in the interaction of
the <code>no-specialization</code> flag and <code>DelayedInit</code> under Scala 2.10, it is safest to do a clean build to upgrade to 2.1.7.
        </p>

        <a name="changes"></a>
        <h2>Changes</h2>

        <ul>
<li>In <a href='@scaladocsPageUrl("org.scalatest.concurrent.AsyncAssertions")'><code>AsyncAssertions</code></a>, if a <a href='@scaladocsPageUrl("org.scalatest.concurrent.AsyncAssertions$Waiter")'>><code>Waiter</code></a> receives <em>more </em> than the expected number of dismissals, it will no longer report
this as an error: <em>i.e.</em>, receiving greater than the number of expected dismissals without any failed assertion will simply
cause the the test to complete, not to fail. As of 2.1.7, the only way a <code>Waiter</code> will cause a test to fail is if one of the
asynchronous assertions to which it is applied fails.</li>

            <li><p>Compiled ScalaTest 2.1.7 without the <code>no-specialization</code> flag. This flag was set in the ScalaTest build several years ago to work around a bug in the Scala 
compiler. Although that compiler bug was fixed, the <code>no-specialization</code> flag persisted under the radar in the ScalaTest build until now. In theory the removal
of this flag in the ScalaTest build shouldn't affect any users, but because of a bug in the interaction of Scala's <code>DelayedInit</code> flag and
the <code>no-specialization</code> flag in Scala 2.10, there's a chance some users may need to recompile their tests without the <code>no-specialiation</code>
flag under 2.10.
</p>
<p>
The only place <code>DelayedInit</code> appears in ScalaTest is in its
<a href='@scaladocsPageUrl("org.scalatest.fixture.NoArg")'><code>NoArg</code></a> trait. The documentation for this trait recommends using
it only as a last resort, when none of the other, simpler alternatives for sharing fixtures will suffice. So <code>NoArg</code> should be only rarely used, but
if you have used it and lightening strikes, it will take the form of a <code>NoSuchMethodError</code> when your tests run even though everything has compiled fine.
To solve this problem, do a clean build of your project without the <code>no-specialization</code> flag. If you have any problems with this, please
post to ScalaTest users and we'll help you out.</p>
