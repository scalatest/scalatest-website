This user guide will help you get rolling quickly with ScalaTest. First a brief orientation:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The central concept in ScalaTest is the <em>suite</em>, a collection of zero to many tests.</li>
<li>A <em>test</em> can be anything with a name that can start and either succeed or fail.</li>
<li>The design of ScalaTest is embodied in trait <code>Suite</code>, which represents a suite of tests.</li>
<li>Trait <code>Suite</code> declares <code>run</code> and nine other &#8220;lifecycle&#8221; methods that define a default way to write and run tests.</li>
<li>The lifecycle methods can be overridden to define custom ways of writing and running tests.</li>
<li>ScalaTest offers several <em>style traits</em> that override lifecycle methods to support different styles of testing, such
as TDD, BDD, and acceptance testing.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This user guide shows how to write tests primarily using <code>FlatSpec</code>, a style trait for behavior-driven development (BDD). 
ScalaTest is very consistent, so the concepts you learn about <code>FlatSpec</code> will apply if you later decide to use a different
style trait. For information about other styles, this user guide will point you to the <a href='@scaladocsPageUrl("org.scalatest.package")'>Scaladoc documentation</a>.
ScalaTest has extensive Scaladoc documention that includes tutorials with many examples that can help you get moving quickly
using any style.
