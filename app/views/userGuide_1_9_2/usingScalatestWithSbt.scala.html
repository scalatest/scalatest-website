<h1>Using ScalaTest with sbt</h1>

<p>
ScalaTest's <a href="@latestScaladoc/#org.scalatest.tools.ScalaTestFramework"><code>ScalaTestFramework</code></a> supports using ScalaTest from sbt.
In sbt version 0.10 and higher, simply add a line like this to your project file:
</p>

<pre class="stGrayback">
libraryDependencies += "org.scalatest" %% "scalatest" % "1.6.1" % "test"
</pre>

<p>
The above line will work for any version of Scala 2.9. For example, it works for Scala 2.9.0-1.
If you're using 2.8.1 or 2.8.2, you can write this:
</p>

<pre class="stGrayback">
libraryDependencies += "org.scalatest" %% "scalatest" % "1.5.1" % "test"
</pre>

<p>
Your test sources files go into <code>src/test/scala</code>. You can run all of them from the sbt console with:
</p>

<pre class="stGrayback">
&gt; test
</pre>

<p>
If you want to run particular suites, use <code>test-only</code> and provide their fully qualified names in a space separated list:
</p>

<pre class="stGrayback">
&gt; test-only org.acme.RedSuite org.acme.BlueSuite
</pre>

<p>
You can configure the output shown when running with sbt in four ways: 1) turn off color, 2) show
short stack traces, 3) full stack traces, and 4) show durations for everything. To do so you must
pass a <code>-o</code> argument to ScalaTest, and after the -o, place any combination of:
</p>

<ul>
<li>D - show durations</li>
<li>S - show short stack traces</li>
<li>F - show full stack traces</li>
<li>W - without color</li>
</ul>

<p>
For example, "-oDF" would show full stack traces and durations (the amount
of time spent in each test).
</p>

<p>
To pass arguments from sbt to ScalaTest you can either add test options globally, like this:
</p>

<pre class="stGrayback">
testOptions in Test += Tests.Argument("-oD")
</pre>

<p>
Or if you are using more than one test framework, like this:
</p>

<pre class="stGrayback">
testOptions in Test += Tests.Argument(TestFrameworks.ScalaTest, "-oD")
</pre>

<p>
You can also pass arguments for individual runs by placing them after <code>--</code>, like this:
</p>

<pre class="stGrayback">
&gt; test-only org.acme.RedSuite -- -oD
</pre>

</div>
}
