<h1>Invoking <code>execute</code></h1>

<p>
The core design of ScalaTest is that you can ask a suite of tests to run itself, enabling easy customization. You do this by invoking
<code>run</code> on <code>Suite</code>. The <code>run</code> method takes several parameters, making <code>run</code> inconvenient
to call from the Scala interpreter. For this purpose, ScalaTest provides an alternative to <code>run</code> 
called <code>execute</code>. You can invoke <code>execute</code> on any <code>Suite</code>.
</p>

<p>
The <code>execute</code> method invokes <code>run</code> on the same <code>Suite</code>, passing in values that can be configured via the parameters
to <code>execute</code>, all of which have default values. Here's a summary of this method's parameters:
</p>

<ul>
<li><code>testName</code> - an optional string name of a test to run</li>
<li><code>configMap</code> - a possibly empty map of configuration objects</li>
<li><code>color</code> - boolean indicating whether output should be printed with ANSI colors</li>
<li><code>durations</code> - boolean indicating whether to print durations for tests and suites (<em>i.e.</em>, how long they took to run)</li>
<li><code>shortstacks</code> - boolean indicating whether to print durations short (truncated) stack traces for errors</li>
<li><code>fullstacks</code> - boolean indicating whether to print durations full stack traces for errors</li>
<li><code>stats</code> - boolean indicating whether to print statistics before and after the run</li>
</ul>

<p>
Here are the details on these parameters:
</p>

<p>
<strong>The <code>testName</code> parameter</strong>
</p>

<p>
If you leave <code>testName</code> at its default value (of <code>null</code>), this method will pass <code>None</code> to
the <code>testName</code> parameter of <code>run</code>, and as a result all the tests in this suite will be executed. If you
specify a <code>testName</code>, this method will pass <code>Some(testName)</code> to <code>run</code>, and only that test
will be run. Thus to run all tests in a suite from the Scala interpreter, you can write:
</p>

<pre class="stREPL">
scala> (new ExampleSuite).execute()
</pre>

<p>
To run just the test named <code>"my favorite test"</code> in a suite from the Scala interpreter, you would write:
</p>

<pre class="stREPL">
scala> (new ExampleSuite).execute("my favorite test")
</pre>

<p>
Or:
</p>

<pre class="stREPL">
scala> (new ExampleSuite).execute(testName = "my favorite test")
</pre>

<p>
<strong>The <code>configMap</code> parameter</strong>
</p>

<p>
If you provide a value for the <code>configMap</code> parameter, this method will pass it to <code>run</code>. If not, the default value
of an empty <code>Map</code> will be passed. For more information on how to use a config map to configure your test suites, see
the <a href="@latestScaladoc/#org.scalatest.Suite@@configMapSection">config map section</a> in the main documentation for trait <code>Suite</code>. Here's an example in which you configure
a run with the name of an input file:
</p>

<pre class="stREPL">
scala> (new ExampleSuite).execute(configMap = Map("inputFileName" -> "in.txt")
</pre>

<p>
<strong>The <code>color</code> parameter</strong>
</p>

<p>
If you leave the <code>color</code> parameter unspecified, this method will configure the reporter it passes to <code>run</code> to print
to the standard output in color (via ansi escape characters). If you don't want color output, specify false for <code>color</code>, like this:
</p>

<pre class="stREPL">
scala> (new ExampleSuite).execute(color = false)
</pre>

<p>
<strong>The <code>durations</code> parameter</strong>
</p>

<p>
If you leave the <code>durations</code> parameter unspecified, this method will configure the reporter it passes to <code>run</code> to
<em>not</em> print durations for tests and suites to the standard output. If you want durations printed, specify true for <code>durations</code>,
like this:
</p>

<pre class="stREPL">
scala> (new ExampleSuite).execute(durations = true)
</pre>

<p>
<strong>The <code>shortstacks</code> and <code>fullstacks</code> parameters</strong>
</p>

<p>
If you leave both the <code>shortstacks</code> and <code>fullstacks</code> parameters unspecified, this method will configure the reporter
it passes to <code>run</code> to <em>not</em> print stack traces for failed tests if it has a stack depth that identifies the offending
line of test code. If you prefer a short stack trace (10 to 15 stack frames) to be printed with any test failure, specify true for
<code>shortstacks</code>:
</p>

<pre class="stREPL">
scala> (new ExampleSuite).execute(shortstacks = true)
</pre>

<p>
For full stack traces, set <code>fullstacks</code> to true:
</p>

<pre class="stREPL">
scala> (new ExampleSuite).execute(fullstacks = true)
</pre>

<p>
If you specify true for both <code>shortstacks</code> and <code>fullstacks</code>, you'll get full stack traces.
</p>

<p>
<strong>The <code>stats</code> parameter</strong>
</p>

<p>
If you leave the <code>stats</code> parameter unspecified, this method will <em>not</em> fire <code>RunStarting</code> and either <code>RunCompleted</code>
or <code>RunAborted</code> events to the reporter it passes to <code>run</code>.
If you specify true for <code>stats</code>, this method will fire the run events to the reporter, and the reporter will print the
expected test count before the run, and various statistics after, including the number of suites completed and number of tests that
succeeded, failed, were ignored or marked pending. Here's how you get the stats:
</p>

<pre class="stREPL">
scala> (new ExampleSuite).execute(stats = true)
</pre>

<p>
Note:  In ScalaTest, the terms "execute" and "run" basically mean the same thing and
can be used interchangably. The reason this method isn't named <code>run</code> is that it takes advantage of
default arguments, and you can't mix overloaded methods and default arguments in Scala. (If named <code>run</code>,
this method would have the same name but different arguments than the main <code>run</code> method that
takes seven arguments. Thus it would overload and couldn't be used with default argument values.)
</p>

<p>
Design note: This method has two "features" that may seem unidiomatic. First, the default value of <code>testName</code> is <code>null</code>.
Normally in Scala the type of <code>testName</code> would be <code>Option[String]</code> and the default value would
be <code>None</code>, as it is in this trait's <code>run</code> method. The <code>null</code> value is used here for two reasons. First, in
ScalaTest 1.5, <code>execute</code> was changed from four overloaded methods to one method with default values, taking advantage of
the default and named parameters feature introduced in Scala 2.8.
To not break existing source code, <code>testName</code> needed to have type <code>String</code>, as it did in two of the overloaded
<code>execute</code> methods prior to 1.5. The other reason is that <code>execute</code> has always been designed to be called primarily
from an interpeter environment, such as the Scala REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop). In an interpreter environment, minimizing keystrokes is king.
A <code>String</code> type with a <code>null</code> default value lets users type <code>suite.execute("my test name")</code> rather than
<code>suite.execute(Some("my test name"))</code>, saving several keystrokes.
</p>

<p>
The second non-idiomatic feature is that <code>shortstacks</code> and <code>fullstacks</code> are all lower case rather than
camel case. This is done to be consistent with the <a href="using_the_scalatest_shell"><code>Shell</code></a>, which also uses those forms. The reason 
lower case is used in the <code>Shell</code> is to save keystrokes in an interpreter environment.  Most Unix commands, for
example, are all lower case, making them easier and quicker to type.  In the ScalaTest
<code>Shell</code>, methods like <code>shortstacks</code>, <code>fullstacks</code>, and <code>nostats</code>, <em>etc.</em>, are 
designed to be all lower case so they feel more like shell commands than methods.
