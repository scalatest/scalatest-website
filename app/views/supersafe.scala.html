<h1>ScalaTest support in SuperSafe Community Edition</h1>

<p>
<a href="http://www.artima.com/supersafe_user_guide.html">Artima SuperSafe</a> is a commercial Scala compiler plugin with a free Community Edition
that checks ScalaTest/Scalactic <code>===</code> and matcher expressions for correctness.
Using SuperSafe Community Edition together with ScalaTest can save you time and ensure certain
errors do not exist in your code. (See the
<a href="#installation">installation section</a> below for instructions
on installing SuperSafe Community Edition.)

<a name="installation"></a>
<h2>Installation of SuperSafe Community Edition</h2>

<p>
If you are using sbt as your build tool, you can install the SuperSafe Community Edition in two easy steps.
</p>

<p>
1. Add the <em>Artima Maven Repository</em> as a resolver in ~/.sbt/0.13/global.sbt, like this:
</p>

<pre class="stGrayback">
resolvers += "Artima Maven Repository" at "http://repo.artima.com/releases"
</pre>

<p>
2. Add the following line to your project/plugins.sbt:
</p>

<pre class="stGrayback">
addSbtPlugin("com.artima.supersafe" % "sbtplugin" % "@{latestSuperSafeVersion}")
</pre>

<p>
<em>Note: If using ScalaTest 2.2.6 or earlier, use SuperSafe version 1.1.0-RC6 instead, which
will be the last version of SuperSafe to support ScalaTest 2.x.</em>
<p>

<p>
If you are using Maven as your build tool, you can install the community edition of SuperSafe by adding the compiler plugin to your <code>pom.xml</code>, like this:
</p>

<pre class="stGrayback">
&lt;plugin&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;net.alchim31.maven&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;scala-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;configuration&gt;
        &lt;compilerPlugins&gt;
            <b>&lt;compilerPlugin&gt;
                &lt;groupId&gt;com.artima.supersafe&lt;/groupId&gt;
                &lt;artifactId&gt;supersafe_@{supersafeScalaVersion}&lt;/artifactId&gt;
                &lt;version&gt;@{latestSuperSafeVersion}&lt;/version&gt;
            &lt;/compilerPlugin&gt;</b>
        &lt;/compilerPlugins&gt;
    &lt;/configuration&gt;
    &lt;executions&gt;
        ...
    &lt;/executions&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;
</pre>

<p>
<em>Note: If using ScalaTest 2.2.6 or earlier, use SuperSafe version 1.1.0-RC6 instead, which
will be the last version of SuperSafe to support ScalaTest 2.x.</em>
</p>

<p>
Note: You need to use the exact Scala version in the artifactId, because compiler plugin depends on compiler API that's not binary compatible between Scala minor releases.
