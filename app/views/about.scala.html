<h1>About ScalaTest</h1>

<p>
ScalaTest was written by Bill Venners, George Berger, Chua Chee Seng, and
other contributors starting in late 2007.  ScalaTest, which is almost
exclusively written in Scala, follows and improves upon the Java code
and design of Artima SuiteRunner, a testing tool also written
primarily by Bill Venners, starting in 2001. Over the years a few
other people contributed to SuiteRunner as well, including:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Mark Brouwer</li>
<li>Chua Chee Seng</li>
<li>Chris Daily</li>
<li>Matt Gerrans</li>
<li>John Mitchel</li>
<li>Frank Sommers</li>

</ul>

Several people have helped with ScalaTest, including:

<ul>
<li>Josh Cough</li>
