<h1>Tests as specifications</h1>

<p>
In the behavior-driven development (BDD) style of testing, test suites act as <em>executable specifications</em>&#8212;specifications of system behavior that
can be executed to verify that behavior. ScalaTest provides rich support for this style of testing.
</p>

<p>
In BDD, test names are sentences that specify a bit of desired behavior that the body of the test will ensure is working. This keeps tests focused
on just one thing, making it easier to figure out what behavior has been broken when a test fails. To keep the focus on specifying behavior, the word
&ldquo;test&rdquo; disappears from the source code and is replaced with words that make the code feel more like a specification. For example, in ScalaTest's <a href="@latestScaladoc/#org.scalatest.FunSpec"><code>FunSpec</code></a> trait, you use
the word &ldquo;describe&rdquo; to name and qualify the subject under test, and &ldquo;it&rdquo; to mark the beginning of a sentence about a bit of the subject's behavior.  Here's an example <code>FunSpec</code>:
</p>

<pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">import</span> org.scalatest.FunSpec
<span class="stReserved">import</span> scala.collection.mutable.Stack
<br /><span class="stReserved">class</span> <span class="stType">StackSpec</span> <span class="stReserved">extends</span> <span class="stType">FunSpec</span> {
<br />  describe(<span class="stQuotedString">"A Stack"</span>) {
<br />    it(<span class="stQuotedString">"should pop values in last-in-first-out order"</span>) {
      <span class="stReserved">val</span> stack = <span class="stReserved">new</span> <span class="stType">Stack[Int]</span>
      stack.push(<span class="stLiteral">1</span>)
      stack.push(<span class="stLiteral">2</span>)
      assert(stack.pop() === <span class="stLiteral">2</span>)
      assert(stack.pop() === <span class="stLiteral">1</span>)
    }
<br />    it(<span class="stQuotedString">"should throw NoSuchElementException if an empty stack is popped"</span>) {
      <span class="stReserved">val</span> emptyStack = <span class="stReserved">new</span> <span class="stType">Stack[String]</span>
      intercept[<span class="stType">NoSuchElementException</span>] {
        emptyStack.pop()
      }
    }
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
In addition to source code that reads more like a specification, the BDD approach also
encourages that test run reports also appear more like specifications. In addition to simply
reporting results, specification-style reports can facilitate communication about the system being tested
among stakeholders such as developers, managers, and customers.
For example, were you to run <code>StackSpec</code> from within the Scala interpreter:
</p>

<pre class="stREPL">
scala> (new StackSpec).execute()
</pre>

<p>
You would see ScalaTest's standard-out reporter display the results as
an easy to read as an informal specification of the <em>subject</em> being tested:
</p>

<pre class="stREPL">
<span class="stGreen">A Stack
- should pop values in last-in-first-out order
- should throw NoSuchElementException if an empty stack is popped</span>
</pre>

<p>
ScalaTest also gives you ways to specify with greater granularity than just the test names. For example,
mixing in trait <code>GivenWhenThen</code> would enable you to write code like:
</p>

<pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">import</span> org.scalatest.FunSpec
<span class="stReserved">import</span> org.scalatest.GivenWhenThen
<span class="stReserved">import</span> scala.collection.mutable.Stack
<br /><span class="stReserved">class</span> <span class="stType">StackSpec</span> <span class="stReserved">extends</span> <span class="stType">FunSpec</span> <span class="stReserved">with</span> <span class="stType">GivenWhenThen</span> {
<br />  describe(<span class="stQuotedString">"A Stack"</span>) {
<br />    it(<span class="stQuotedString">"should pop values in last-in-first-out-order"</span>) {
<br />      given(<span class="stQuotedString">"a non-empty stack"</span>)
      <span class="stReserved">val</span> stack = <span class="stReserved">new</span> <span class="stType">Stack[Int]</span>
      stack.push(<span class="stLiteral">1</span>)
      stack.push(<span class="stLiteral">2</span>)
      <span class="stReserved">val</span> oldSize = stack.size
<br />      when(<span class="stQuotedString">"pop is invoked on the stack"</span>)
      <span class="stReserved">val</span> result = stack.pop()
<br />      then(<span class="stQuotedString">"the most recently pushed element should be returned"</span>)
      assert(result === <span class="stLiteral">2</span>)
<br />      and(<span class="stQuotedString">"the stack should have one less item than before"</span>)
      assert(stack.size === oldSize - <span class="stLiteral">1</span>)
    }
<br />    it(<span class="stQuotedString">"should throw NoSuchElementException if an empty stack is popped"</span>) {
<br />      given(<span class="stQuotedString">"an empty stack"</span>)
      <span class="stReserved">val</span> emptyStack = <span class="stReserved">new</span> <span class="stType">Stack[String]</span>
<br />      when(<span class="stQuotedString">"pop is invoked on the stack"</span>)
      then(<span class="stQuotedString">"NoSuchElementException should be thrown"</span>)
      intercept[<span class="stType">NoSuchElementException</span>] {
        emptyStack.pop()
      }
<br />      and(<span class="stQuotedString">"the stack should still be empty"</span>)
      assert(emptyStack.isEmpty)
    }
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
Were you to run this <code>StackSpec</code> in the Scala interpreter, you would see:
</p>

<pre class="stREPL">
<span class="stGreen">A Stack
- should pop values in last-in-first-out-order
  + Given a non-empty stack 
  + When pop is invoked on the stack 
  + Then the most recently pushed element should be returned 
  + And the stack should have one less item than before 
- should throw NoSuchElementException if an empty stack is popped
  + Given an empty stack 
  + When pop is invoked on the stack 
  + Then NoSuchElementException should be thrown 
  + And the stack should still be empty 
</pre>

<p>
ScalaTest provides many traits that facilitate BDD style: Compared to <a href="@latestScaladoc/#org.scalatest.FunSpec"><code>Spec</code></a>,
<a href="@latestScaladoc/#org.scalatest.WordSpec"><code>WordSpec</code></a> and <a href="@latestScaladoc/#org.scalatest.FlatSpec"><code>FlatSpec</code></a> provide more gramatical structure (<em>e.g.</em>,
test names must include <code>should</code>, <code>can</code>, or <code>must</code>), whereas
<a href="@latestScaladoc/#org.scalatest.FreeSpec"><code>FreeSpec</code></a> gives complete freedom to the writer. Other BDD traits facilitate specific kinds of
testing: <a href="@latestScaladoc/#org.scalatest.FeatureSpec"><code>FeatureSpec</code></a>'s syntax
is geared towards acceptance, integration, and functional testing, and <a href="@latestScaladoc/#org.scalatest.PropSpec"><code>PropSpec</code></a>
is geared towards property-based testing.
