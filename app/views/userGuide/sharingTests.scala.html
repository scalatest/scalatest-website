<h1>Sharing tests</h1>

<p>Sometimes you may want to run the same test code on different fixture objects. In other words, you may want to write tests that are &quot;shared&quot;
by different fixture objects.  To accomplish this in a <code>FlatSpec</code>, you first place shared tests in <em>behavior functions</em>.
These behavior functions will be invoked during the construction phase of any <code>FlatSpec</code> that uses them, so that the tests they
contain will be registered as tests in that <code>FlatSpec</code>.  For example, given this stack class:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">import</span> scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer
<br /><span class="stReserved">class</span> <span class="stType">Stack[T]</span> {
<br />  <span class="stReserved">val</span> MAX = <span class="stLiteral">10</span>
  <span class="stReserved">private</span> <span class="stReserved">val</span> buf = <span class="stReserved">new</span> <span class="stType">ListBuffer[T]</span>
<br />  <span class="stReserved">def</span> push(o: T) {
    <span class="stReserved">if</span> (!full)
      buf.prepend(o)
    <span class="stReserved">else</span>
      <span class="stReserved">throw</span> <span class="stReserved">new</span> <span class="stType">IllegalStateException</span>(<span class="stQuotedString">&quot;can't push onto a full stack&quot;</span>)
  }
<br />  <span class="stReserved">def</span> pop(): T = {
    <span class="stReserved">if</span> (!empty)
      buf.remove(<span class="stLiteral">0</span>)
    <span class="stReserved">else</span>
      <span class="stReserved">throw</span> <span class="stReserved">new</span> <span class="stType">IllegalStateException</span>(<span class="stQuotedString">&quot;can't pop an empty stack&quot;</span>)
  }
<br />  <span class="stReserved">def</span> peek: T = {
    <span class="stReserved">if</span> (!empty)
      buf(<span class="stLiteral">0</span>)
    <span class="stReserved">else</span>
      <span class="stReserved">throw</span> <span class="stReserved">new</span> <span class="stType">IllegalStateException</span>(<span class="stQuotedString">&quot;can't pop an empty stack&quot;</span>)
  }
<br />  <span class="stReserved">def</span> full: <span class="stType">Boolean</span> = buf.size == MAX
  <span class="stReserved">def</span> empty: <span class="stType">Boolean</span> = buf.size == <span class="stLiteral">0</span>
  <span class="stReserved">def</span> size = buf.size
<br />  <span class="stReserved">override</span> <span class="stReserved">def</span> toString = buf.mkString(<span class="stQuotedString">&quot;Stack(&quot;</span>, <span class="stQuotedString">&quot;, &quot;</span>, <span class="stQuotedString">&quot;)&quot;</span>)
}
</pre></p><p>You may want to test the <code>Stack</code> class in different states: empty, full, with one item, with one item less than capacity,
<em>etc</em>. You may find you have several tests that make sense any time the stack is non-empty. Thus you'd ideally want to run
those same tests for three stack fixture objects: a full stack, a stack with a one item, and a stack with one item less than
capacity. With shared tests, you can factor these tests out into a behavior function, into which you pass the
stack fixture to use when running the tests. So in your <code>FlatSpec</code> for stack, you'd invoke the
behavior function three times, passing in each of the three stack fixtures so that the shared tests are run for all three fixtures. You
can define a behavior function that encapsulates these shared tests inside the <code>FlatSpec</code> that uses them. If they are shared
between different <code>FlatSpec</code>s, however, you could also define them in a separate trait that is mixed into each <code>FlatSpec</code>
that uses them.</p><p><a name="StackBehaviors">For</a> example, here the <code>nonEmptyStack</code> behavior function (in this case, a behavior <em>method</em>) is
defined in a trait along with another method containing shared tests for non-full stacks:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">trait</span> <span class="stType">StackBehaviors</span> { <span class="stReserved">this</span>: <span class="stType">FlatSpec</span> =&gt;
<br />  <span class="stReserved">def</span> nonEmptyStack(newStack: =&gt; <span class="stType">Stack[Int]</span>, lastItemAdded: <span class="stType">Int</span>) {
<br />    it should <span class="stQuotedString">&quot;be non-empty&quot;</span> in {
      assert(!newStack.empty)
    }
<br />    it should <span class="stQuotedString">&quot;return the top item on peek&quot;</span> in {
      assert(newStack.peek === lastItemAdded)
    }
<br />    it should <span class="stQuotedString">&quot;not remove the top item on peek&quot;</span> in {
      <span class="stReserved">val</span> stack = newStack
      <span class="stReserved">val</span> size = stack.size
      assert(stack.peek === lastItemAdded)
      assert(stack.size === size)
    }
<br />    it should <span class="stQuotedString">&quot;remove the top item on pop&quot;</span> in {
      <span class="stReserved">val</span> stack = newStack
      <span class="stReserved">val</span> size = stack.size
      assert(stack.pop === lastItemAdded)
      assert(stack.size === size - <span class="stLiteral">1</span>)
    }
  }
<br />  <span class="stReserved">def</span> nonFullStack(newStack: =&gt; <span class="stType">Stack[Int]</span>) {
<br />    it should <span class="stQuotedString">&quot;not be full&quot;</span> in {
      assert(!newStack.full)
    }
<br />    it should <span class="stQuotedString">&quot;add to the top on push&quot;</span> in {
      <span class="stReserved">val</span> stack = newStack
      <span class="stReserved">val</span> size = stack.size
      stack.push(<span class="stLiteral">7</span>)
      assert(stack.size === size + <span class="stLiteral">1</span>)
      assert(stack.peek === <span class="stLiteral">7</span>)
    }
  }
}
</pre></p><p>Given these behavior functions, you could invoke them directly, but <code>FlatSpec</code> offers a DSL for the purpose,
which looks like this:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
it should behave like nonEmptyStack(stackWithOneItem, lastValuePushed)
it should behave like nonFullStack(stackWithOneItem)
</pre></p><p>If you prefer to use an imperative style to change fixtures, for example by mixing in <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> and
reassigning a <code>stack</code> <code>var</code> in <code>beforeEach</code>, you could write your behavior functions
in the context of that <code>var</code>, which means you wouldn't need to pass in the stack fixture because it would be
in scope already inside the behavior function. In that case, your code would look like this:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
it should behave like nonEmptyStack <span class="stLineComment">// assuming lastValuePushed is also in scope inside nonEmptyStack</span>
it should behave like nonFullStack
</pre></p><p>The recommended style, however, is the functional, pass-all-the-needed-values-in style. Here's an example:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">class</span> <span class="stType">SharedTestExampleSpec</span> <span class="stReserved">extends</span> <span class="stType">FlatSpec</span> <span class="stReserved">with</span> <span class="stType">StackBehaviors</span> {

    stack
  }
<br />  <span class="stReserved">def</span> stackWithOneItem = {

<br />    behave like nonEmptyStack(stackWithOneItemLessThanCapacity, lastValuePushed)

      fullStack.push(<span class="stLiteral">10</span>)
    }
  }
}
</pre></p><p>If you load these classes into the Scala interpreter (with scalatest's JAR file on the class path), and execute it,
you'll see:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
<span class="stGreen">scala&gt; (new SharedTestExampleSpec).execute()
A Stack (when empty)
- should be empty
- should complain on peek
- should complain on pop
A Stack (with one item)
- should be non-empty
- should return the top item on peek
- should not remove the top item on peek
- should remove the top item on pop
- should not be full
- should add to the top on push
A Stack (with one item less than capacity)
- should be non-empty
- should return the top item on peek
- should not remove the top item on peek
- should remove the top item on pop
- should not be full
- should add to the top on push
A Stack (full)
- should be full
- should be non-empty
- should return the top item on peek
- should not remove the top item on peek
- should remove the top item on pop
- should complain on a push</span>
</pre></p><p>One thing to keep in mind when using shared tests is that in ScalaTest, each test in a suite must have a unique name.
If you register the same tests repeatedly in the same suite, one problem you may encounter is an exception at runtime
complaining that multiple tests are being registered with the same test name. A good way to solve this problem in a <code>FlatSpec</code> is to make sure
each invocation of a behavior function is in the context of a different subject,
which will prepend a string to each test name.
For example, the following code in a <code>FlatSpec</code> would register a test with the name <code>"A Stack (when empty) should be empty"</code>:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
behavior of <span class="stQuotedString">&quot;A Stack (when empty)&quot;</span>
<br />it should <span class="stQuotedString">&quot;be empty&quot;</span> in {
  assert(emptyStack.empty)
}
<span class="stLineComment">// ...</span>
</pre></p><p>Or, using the shorthand notation:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stQuotedString">&quot;A Stack (when empty)&quot;</span> should <span class="stQuotedString">&quot;be empty&quot;</span> in {
  assert(emptyStack.empty)
}
<span class="stLineComment">// ...</span>
</pre></p><p>If the <code>"should be empty"</code> test was factored out into a behavior function, it could be called repeatedly so long
as each invocation of the behavior function is in the context of a different subject.</p>

<h1>Shared tests in other style traits</h1>

<p>
Shared tests are supported in all style traits in which tests are represented as functions, because they require
registering the same test function multiple times, each time parameterized with different fixture objects. In trait <code>Suite</code> tests
are methods, thus shared tests aren't supported. The Scaladoc of each style trait that supports them includes an example of shared tests. 
</p>

A related technique is <a href="/user_guide/property_based_testing">property-based testing</a>. Whereas in shared tests you evaluate the
same test function on different data, in property-based testing you evaluate the same property function on different data.
