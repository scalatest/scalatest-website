are combined with text that specifies the behavior the tests verify.
(Note: In BDD, the word <em>example</em> is usually used instead of <em>test</em>. The word test will not appear
in your code if you use <code>WordSpec</code>, so if you prefer the word <em>example</em> you can use it. However, in this documentation
the word <em>test</em> will be used, for clarity and to be consistent with the rest of ScalaTest.)
Here's an example <code>Spec</code>:</p><p><pre>
import org.scalatest.Spec
import scala.collection.mutable.Stack

class StackSpec extends Spec {

  describe("A Stack") {

    it("should pop values in last-in-first-out order") {
      val stack = new Stack[Int]
      stack.push(1)
      stack.push(2)
      assert(stack.pop() === 2)
      assert(stack.pop() === 1)
    }

    it("should throw NoSuchElementException if an empty stack is popped") {
      val emptyStack = new Stack[String]
      intercept[NoSuchElementException] {
        emptyStack.pop()
      }
    }
  }
}
</pre></p><p>A <code>Spec</code> contains <em>describe clauses</em> and tests. You define a describe clause
with <code>describe</code>, and a test with <code>it</code>. Both
<code>describe</code> and <code>it</code> are methods, defined in
<code>Spec</code>, which will be invoked
by the primary constructor of <code>StackSpec</code>.
A describe clause names, or gives more information about, the <em>subject</em> (class or other entity) you are specifying
and testing. In the previous example, &quot;A Stack&quot;
is the subject under specification and test. With each test you provide a string (the <em>spec text</em>) that specifies
one bit of behavior of the subject, and a block of code that tests that behavior.
You place the spec text between the parentheses, followed by the test code between curly
braces.  The test code will be wrapped up as a function passed as a by-name parameter to
<code>it</code>, which will register the test for later execution.</p><p>A <code>Spec</code>'s lifecycle has two phases: the <em>registration</em> phase and the
<em>ready</em> phase. It starts in registration phase and enters ready phase the first time
<code>run</code> is called on it. It then remains in ready phase for the remainder of its lifetime.</p><p>Tests can only be registered with the <code>it</code> method while the <code>Spec</code> is
in its registration phase. Any attempt to register a test after the <code>Spec</code> has
entered its ready phase, <em>i.e.</em>, after <code>run</code> has been invoked on the <code>Spec</code>,
will be met with a thrown <code>TestRegistrationClosedException</code>. The recommended style
of using <code>Spec</code> is to register tests during object construction as is done in all
the examples shown here. If you keep to the recommended style, you should never see a
<code>TestRegistrationClosedException</code>.</p><p>When you execute a <code>Spec</code>, it will send <code>Formatter</code>s in the events it sends to the
<code>Reporter</code>. ScalaTest's built-in reporters will report these events in such a way
that the output is easy to read as an informal specification of the <em>subject</em> being tested.
For example, if you ran <code>StackSpec</code> from within the Scala interpreter:</p><p><pre>
scala> (new StackSpec).execute()
</pre></p><p>You would see:</p><p><pre>
A Stack
- should pop values in last-in-first-out order
- should throw NoSuchElementException if an empty stack is popped
</pre></p><h4> Shared fixtures </h4><p>A test <em>fixture</em> is objects or other artifacts (such as files, sockets, database
connections, etc.) used by tests to do their work. You can use fixtures in
<code>Spec</code>s with the same approaches suggested for <code>Suite</code> in
its documentation. The same text that appears in the test fixture
section of <code>Suite</code>'s documentation is repeated here, with examples changed from
<code>Suite</code> to <code>Spec</code>.</p><p>If a fixture is used by only one test, then the definitions of the fixture objects can
be local to the test function, such as the objects assigned to <code>stack</code> and <code>emptyStack</code> in the
previous <code>StackSpec</code> examples. If multiple tests need to share a fixture, the best approach
is to assign them to instance variables. Here's a (very contrived) example, in which the object assigned
to <code>shared</code> is used by multiple test functions:</p><p><pre>
import org.scalatest.Spec

class ArithmeticSpec extends Spec {

  // Sharing immutable fixture objects via instance variables
  val shared = 5

  it("should add correctly") {
    val sum = 2 + 3
    assert(sum === shared)
  }

  it("should subtract correctly") {
    val diff = 7 - 2
    assert(diff === shared)
  }
}
</pre></p><p>In some cases, however, shared <em>mutable</em> fixture objects may be changed by tests such that
they need to be recreated or reinitialized before each test. Shared resources such
as files or database connections may also need to
be created and initialized before, and cleaned up after, each test. JUnit offers methods <code>setUp</code> and
<code>tearDown</code> for this purpose. In ScalaTest, you can use the <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> trait,
which will be described later, to implement an approach similar to JUnit's <code>setUp</code>
and <code>tearDown</code>, however, this approach often involves reassigning <code>var</code>s
between tests. Before going that route, you should consider some approaches that
avoid <code>var</code>s. One approach is to write one or more <em>create-fixture</em> methods
that return a new instance of a needed object (or a tuple or case class holding new instances of
multiple objects) each time it is called. You can then call a create-fixture method at the beginning of each
test that needs the fixture, storing the fixture object or objects in local variables. Here's an example:</p><p><pre>
import org.scalatest.Spec
import scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer

class MySpec extends Spec {

  // create objects needed by tests and return as a tuple
  def createFixture = (
    new StringBuilder("ScalaTest is "),
    new ListBuffer[String]
  )

  it("should mutate shared fixture objects") {
    val (builder, lbuf) = createFixture
    builder.append("easy!")
    assert(builder.toString === "ScalaTest is easy!")
    assert(lbuf.isEmpty)
    lbuf += "sweet"
  }

  it("should get a fresh set of mutable fixture objects") {
    val (builder, lbuf) = createFixture
    builder.append("fun!")
    assert(builder.toString === "ScalaTest is fun!")
    assert(lbuf.isEmpty)
  }
}
</pre></p><p>If different tests in the same <code>Spec</code> require different fixtures, you can create multiple create-fixture methods and
call the method (or methods) needed by each test at the begining of the test. If every test requires the same set of
mutable fixture objects, one other approach you can take is make them simply <code>val</code>s and mix in trait
<a href="OneInstancePerTest.html"><code>OneInstancePerTest</code></a>.  If you mix in <code>OneInstancePerTest</code>, each test
will be run in its own instance of the <code>Spec</code>, similar to the way JUnit tests are executed.</p><p>Although the create-fixture and <code>OneInstancePerTest</code> approaches take care of setting up a fixture before each
test, they don't address the problem of cleaning up a fixture after the test completes. In this situation,
one option is to mix in the <a href="BeforeAndAfterEach.html"><code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code></a> trait.
<code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code>'s <code>beforeEach</code> method will be run before, and its <code>afterEach</code>
method after, each test (like JUnit's <code>setUp</code>  and <code>tearDown</code>
methods, respectively).
For example, you could create a temporary file before each test, and delete it afterwords, like this:</p><p><pre>
import org.scalatest.Spec
import org.scalatest.BeforeAndAfterEach
import java.io.FileReader
import java.io.FileWriter
import java.io.File

class MySpec extends Spec with BeforeAndAfterEach {

  private val FileName = "TempFile.txt"
  private var reader: FileReader = _

  // Set up the temp file needed by the test
  override def beforeEach() {
    val writer = new FileWriter(FileName)
    try {
      writer.write("Hello, test!")
    }
    finally {
      writer.close()
    }

    // Create the reader needed by the test
    reader = new FileReader(FileName)
  }

  // Close and delete the temp file
  override def afterEach() {
    reader.close()
    val file = new File(FileName)
    file.delete()
  }

  it("should read from a temp file") {
    var builder = new StringBuilder
    var c = reader.read()
    while (c != -1) {
      builder.append(c.toChar)
      c = reader.read()
    }
    assert(builder.toString === "Hello, test!")
  }

  it("should read the first char of a temp file") {
    assert(reader.read() === 'H')
  }

  it("should work without a fixture") {
    assert(1 + 1 === 2)
  }
}
</pre></p><p>In this example, the instance variable <code>reader</code> is a <code>var</code>, so
it can be reinitialized between tests by the <code>beforeEach</code> method.</p><p>Although the <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> approach should be familiar to the users of most
test other frameworks, ScalaTest provides another alternative that also allows you to perform cleanup
after each test: overriding <code>withFixture(NoArgTest)</code>.
To execute each test, <code>Suite</code>'s implementation of the <code>runTest</code> method wraps an invocation
of the appropriate test method in a no-arg function. <code>runTest</code> passes that test function to the <code>withFixture(NoArgTest)</code>
method, which is responsible for actually running the test by invoking the function. <code>Suite</code>'s
implementation of <code>withFixture(NoArgTest)</code> simply invokes the function, like this:</p><p><pre>
// Default implementation
protected def withFixture(test: NoArgTest) {
  test()
}
</pre></p><p>The <code>withFixture(NoArgTest)</code> method exists so that you can override it and set a fixture up before, and clean it up after, each test.
Thus, the previous temp file example could also be implemented without mixing in <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code>, like this:</p><p><pre>
import org.scalatest.Spec
import org.scalatest.BeforeAndAfterEach
import java.io.FileReader
import java.io.FileWriter
import java.io.File

class MySpec extends Spec {

  private var reader: FileReader = _

  override def withFixture(test: NoArgTest) {

    val FileName = "TempFile.txt"

    // Set up the temp file needed by the test
    val writer = new FileWriter(FileName)
    try {
      writer.write("Hello, test!")
    }
    finally {
      writer.close()
    }

    // Create the reader needed by the test
    reader = new FileReader(FileName)

    try {
      test() // Invoke the test function
    }
    finally {
      // Close and delete the temp file
      reader.close()
      val file = new File(FileName)
      file.delete()
    }
  }

  it("should read from a temp file") {
    var builder = new StringBuilder
    var c = reader.read()
    while (c != -1) {
      builder.append(c.toChar)
      c = reader.read()
    }
    assert(builder.toString === "Hello, test!")
  }

  it("should read the first char of a temp file") {
    assert(reader.read() === 'H')
  }

  it("should work without a fixture") {
    assert(1 + 1 === 2)
  }
}
</pre></p><p>If you prefer to keep your test classes immutable, one final variation is to use the
<a href="fixture/FixtureSpec.html"><code>FixtureSpec</code></a> trait from the
<code>org.scalatest.fixture</code> package.  Tests in an <code>org.scalatest.fixture.FixtureSpec</code> can have a fixture
object passed in as a parameter. You must indicate the type of the fixture object
by defining the <code>Fixture</code> type member and define a <code>withFixture</code> method that takes a <em>one-arg</em> test function.
(A <code>FixtureSpec</code> has two overloaded <code>withFixture</code> methods, therefore, one that takes a <code>OneArgTest</code>
and the other, inherited from <code>Suite</code>, that takes a <code>NoArgTest</code>.)
Inside the <code>withFixture(OneArgTest)</code> method, you create the fixture, pass it into the test function, then perform any
necessary cleanup after the test function returns. Instead of invoking each test directly, a <code>FixtureSpec</code> will
pass a function that invokes the code of a test to <code>withFixture(OneArgTest)</code>. Your <code>withFixture(OneArgTest)</code> method, therefore,
is responsible for actually running the code of the test by invoking the test function.
For example, you could pass the temp file reader fixture to each test that needs it
by overriding the <code>withFixture(OneArgTest)</code> method of a <code>FixtureSpec</code>, like this:</p><p><pre>
import org.scalatest.fixture.FixtureSpec
import java.io.FileReader
import java.io.FileWriter
import java.io.File

class MySuite extends FixtureSpec {

  type FixtureParam = FileReader

  def withFixture(test: OneArgTest) {

    val FileName = "TempFile.txt"

    // Set up the temp file needed by the test
    val writer = new FileWriter(FileName)
    try {
      writer.write("Hello, test!")
    }
    finally {
      writer.close()
    }

    // Create the reader needed by the test
    val reader = new FileReader(FileName)

    try {
      // Run the test using the temp file
      test(reader)
    }
    finally {
      // Close and delete the temp file
      reader.close()
      val file = new File(FileName)
      file.delete()
    }
  }

  it("should read from a temp file") { reader =>
    var builder = new StringBuilder
    var c = reader.read()
    while (c != -1) {
      builder.append(c.toChar)
      c = reader.read()
    }
    assert(builder.toString === "Hello, test!")
  }

  it("should read the first char of a temp file") { reader =>
    assert(reader.read() === 'H')
  }

  it("should work without a fixture") { () =>
    assert(1 + 1 === 2)
  }
}
</pre></p><p>It is worth noting that the only difference in the test code between the mutable
<code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> approach shown here and the immutable <code>FixtureSpec</code>
approach shown previously is that two of the <code>FixtureSpec</code>'s test functions take a <code>FileReader</code> as
a parameter via the &quot;<code>reader =></code>&quot; at the beginning of the function. Otherwise the test code is identical.
One benefit of the explicit parameter is that, as demonstrated
by the &quot;<code>should work without a fixture</code>&quot; test, a <code>FixtureSpec</code>
test need not take the fixture. So you can have some tests that take a fixture, and others that don't.
In this case, the <code>FixtureSpec</code> provides documentation indicating which
tests use the fixture and which don't, whereas the <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> approach does not.
(If you have want to combine tests that take different fixture types in the same <code>Spec</code>, you can
use <a href="fixture/MultipleFixtureSpec.html">MultipleFixtureSpec</a>.)</p><p>If you want to execute code before and after all tests (and nested suites) in a suite, such
want to execute code before and after all tests (and nested suites) in a suite, such
as you could do with <code>@BeforeClass</code> and <code>@AfterClass</code>
annotations in JUnit 4, you can use the <code>beforeAll</code> and <code>afterAll</code>
methods of <code>BeforeAndAfterAll</code>. See the documentation for <code>BeforeAndAfterAll</code> for
an example.</p><p><a name="SharedTests"> </a></p><h4> Shared tests </h4><p>Sometimes you may want to run the same test code on different fixture objects. In other words, you may want to write tests that are &quot;shared&quot;
by different fixture objects.
To accomplish this in a <code>Spec</code>, you first place shared tests in <em>behavior functions</em>. These behavior functions will be
invoked during the construction phase of any <code>Spec</code> that uses them, so that the tests they contain will be registered as tests in that <code>Spec</code>.
For example, given this stack class:</p><p><pre>
import scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer

class Stack[T] {

  val MAX = 10
  private var buf = new ListBuffer[T]

  def push(o: T) {
    if (!full)
      o +: buf
    else
      throw new IllegalStateException("can't push onto a full stack")
  }

  def pop(): T = {
    if (!empty)
      buf.remove(0)
    else
      throw new IllegalStateException("can't pop an empty stack")
  }

  def peek: T = {
    if (!empty)
      buf(0)
    else
      throw new IllegalStateException("can't pop an empty stack")
  }

  def full: Boolean = buf.size == MAX
  def empty: Boolean = buf.size == 0
  def size = buf.size

  override def toString = buf.mkString("Stack(", ", ", ")")
}
</pre></p><p>You may want to test the <code>Stack</code> class in different states: empty, full, with one item, with one item less than capacity,
<em>etc</em>. You may find you have several tests that make sense any time the stack is non-empty. Thus you'd ideally want to run
those same tests for three stack fixture objects: a full stack, a stack with a one item, and a stack with one item less than
capacity. With shared tests, you can factor these tests out into a behavior function, into which you pass the
stack fixture to use when running the tests. So in your <code>Spec</code> for stack, you'd invoke the
behavior function three times, passing in each of the three stack fixtures so that the shared tests are run for all three fixtures. You
can define a behavior function that encapsulates these shared tests inside the <code>Spec</code> that uses them. If they are shared
between different <code>Spec</code>s, however, you could also define them in a separate trait that is mixed into each <code>Spec</code> that uses them.</p><p><a name="StackBehaviors">For</a> example, here the <code>nonEmptyStack</code> behavior function (in this case, a behavior <em>method</em>) is defined in a trait along with another
method containing shared tests for non-full stacks:</p><p><pre>
trait StackBehaviors { this: Spec =>

  def nonEmptyStack(stack: Stack[Int], lastItemAdded: Int) {

    it("should be non-empty") {
      assert(!stack.empty)
    }

    it("should return the top item on peek") {
      assert(stack.peek === lastItemAdded)
    }

    it("should not remove the top item on peek") {
      val size = stack.size
      assert(stack.peek === lastItemAdded)
      assert(stack.size === size)
    }

    it("should remove the top item on pop") {
      val size = stack.size
      assert(stack.pop === lastItemAdded)
      assert(stack.size === size - 1)
    }
  }

  def nonFullStack(stack: Stack[Int]) {

    it("should not be full") {
      assert(!stack.full)
    }

    it("should add to the top on push") {
      val size = stack.size
      stack.push(7)
      assert(stack.size === size + 1)
      assert(stack.peek === 7)
    }
  }
}
</pre></p><p>Given these behavior functions, you could invoke them directly, but <code>Spec</code> offers a DSL for the purpose,
which looks like this:</p><p><pre>
it should behave like nonEmptyStack(stackWithOneItem, lastValuePushed)
it should behave like nonFullStack(stackWithOneItem)
</pre></p><p>If you prefer to use an imperative style to change fixtures, for example by mixing in <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> and
reassigning a <code>stack</code> <code>var</code> in <code>beforeEach</code>, you could write your behavior functions
in the context of that <code>var</code>, which means you wouldn't need to pass in the stack fixture because it would be
in scope already inside the behavior function. In that case, your code would look like this:</p><p><pre>
it should behave like nonEmptyStack // assuming lastValuePushed is also in scope inside nonEmptyStack
it should behave like nonFullStack
</pre></p><p>The recommended style, however, is the functional, pass-all-the-needed-values-in style. Here's an example:</p><p><pre>
class SharedTestExampleSpec extends Spec with StackBehaviors {

  // Stack fixture creation methods
  def emptyStack = new Stack[Int]

  def fullStack = {
    val stack = new Stack[Int]
    for (i <- 0 until stack.MAX)
      stack.push(i)
    stack
  }

  def stackWithOneItem = {
    val stack = new Stack[Int]
    stack.push(9)
    stack
  }

  def stackWithOneItemLessThanCapacity = {
    val stack = new Stack[Int]
    for (i <- 1 to 9)
      stack.push(i)
    stack
  }

  val lastValuePushed = 9

  describe("A Stack") {

    describe("(when empty)") {

      it("should be empty") {
        assert(emptyStack.empty)
      }

      it("should complain on peek") {
        intercept[IllegalStateException] {
          emptyStack.peek
        }
      }

      it("should complain on pop") {
        intercept[IllegalStateException] {
          emptyStack.pop
        }
      }
    }

    describe("(with one item)") {
      it should behave like nonEmptyStack(stackWithOneItem, lastValuePushed)
      it should behave like nonFullStack(stackWithOneItem)
    }

    describe("(with one item less than capacity)") {
      it should behave like nonEmptyStack(stackWithOneItemLessThanCapacity, lastValuePushed)
      it should behave like nonFullStack(stackWithOneItemLessThanCapacity)
    }

    describe("(full)") {

      it("should be full") {
        assert(fullStack.full)
      }

      it should behave like nonEmptyStack(fullStack, lastValuePushed)

      it("should complain on a push") {
        intercept[IllegalStateException] {
          fullStack.push(10)
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
</pre></p><p>If you load these classes into the Scala interpreter (with scalatest's JAR file on the class path), and execute it,
you'll see:</p><p><pre>
scala> (new StackSpec).execute()
A Stack (when empty)
- should be empty
- should complain on peek
- should complain on pop
A Stack (with one item)
- should be non-empty
- should return the top item on peek
- should not remove the top item on peek
- should remove the top item on pop
- should not be full
- should add to the top on push
A Stack (with one item less than capacity)
- should be non-empty
- should return the top item on peek
- should not remove the top item on peek
- should remove the top item on pop
- should not be full
- should add to the top on push
A Stack (full)
- should be full
- should be non-empty
- should return the top item on peek
- should not remove the top item on peek
- should remove the top item on pop
- should complain on a push
</pre></p><p>One thing to keep in mind when using shared tests is that in ScalaTest, each test in a suite must have a unique name.
If you register the same tests repeatedly in the same suite, one problem you may encounter is an exception at runtime
complaining that multiple tests are being registered with the same test name. A good way to solve this problem in a <code>Spec</code> is to surround
each invocation of a behavior function with a <code>describe</code> clause, which will prepend a string to each test name.
For example, the following code in a <code>Spec</code> would register a test with the name <code>"A Stack (when empty) should be empty"</code>:</p><p><pre>
  describe("A Stack") {

    describe("(when empty)") {

      it("should be empty") {
        assert(emptyStack.empty)
      }
      // ...
</pre></p><p>If the <code>"should be empty"</code> test was factored out into a behavior function, it could be called repeatedly so long
as each invocation of the behavior function is inside a different set of <code>describe</code> clauses.</p><h4> Tagging tests </h4><p>A <code>Spec</code>'s tests may be classified into groups by <em>tagging</em> them with string names.
As with any suite, when executing a <code>Spec</code>, groups of tests can
optionally be included and/or excluded. To tag a <code>Spec</code>'s tests,
you pass objects that extend abstract class <code>org.scalatest.Tag</code> to the methods
that register tests, <code>it</code> and <code>ignore</code>. Class <code>Tag</code> takes one parameter,
a string name.  If you have
created Java annotation interfaces for use as group names in direct subclasses of <code>org.scalatest.Suite</code>,
then you will probably want to use group names on your <code>Spec</code>s that match. To do so, simply
pass the fully qualified names of the Java interfaces to the <code>Tag</code> constructor. For example, if you've
defined Java annotation interfaces with fully qualified names, <code>com.mycompany.groups.SlowTest</code> and <code>com.mycompany.groups.DbTest</code>, then you could
create matching groups for <code>Spec</code>s like this:</p><p><pre>
import org.scalatest.Tag

object SlowTest extends Tag("com.mycompany.groups.SlowTest")
object DbTest extends Tag("com.mycompany.groups.DbTest")
</pre></p><p>Given these definitions, you could place <code>Spec</code> tests into groups like this:</p><p><pre>
import org.scalatest.Spec

class MySuite extends Spec {

  it("should add correctly", SlowTest) {
    val sum = 1 + 1
    assert(sum === 2)
    assert(sum + 2 === 4)
  }

  it("should subtract correctly", SlowTest, DbTest) {
    val diff = 4 - 1
    assert(diff === 3)
    assert(diff - 2 === 1)
  }
}
</pre></p><p>This code marks both tests with the <code>com.mycompany.groups.SlowTest</code> tag,
and test <code>"should subtract correctly"</code> with the <code>com.mycompany.groups.DbTest</code> tag.</p><p>The primary <code>run</code> method takes a <code>Filter</code>, whose constructor takes an optional
<code>Set[String]</code>s called <code>tagsToInclude</code> and a <code>Set[String]</code> called
<code>tagsToExclude</code>. If <code>tagsToInclude</code> is <code>None</code>, all tests will be run
except those those belonging to tags listed in the
<code>tagsToExclude</code> <code>Set</code>. If <code>tagsToInclude</code> is defined, only tests
belonging to tags mentioned in the <code>tagsToInclude</code> set, and not mentioned in <code>tagsToExclude</code>,
will be run.</p><h4> Ignored tests </h4><p>To support the common use case of &#8220;temporarily&#8221; disabling a test, with the
good intention of resurrecting the test at a later time, <code>Spec</code> provides registration
methods that start with <code>ignore</code> instead of <code>it</code>. For example, to temporarily
disable the test with the name <code>"should pop values in last-in-first-out order"</code>, just change &#8220;<code>it</code>&#8221; into &#8220;<code>ignore</code>,&#8221; like this:</p><p><pre>
import org.scalatest.Spec
import scala.collection.mutable.Stack

class StackSpec extends Spec {

  describe("A Stack") {

    ignore("should pop values in last-in-first-out order") {
      val stack = new Stack[Int]
      stack.push(1)
      stack.push(2)
      assert(stack.pop() === 2)
      assert(stack.pop() === 1)
    }

    it("should throw NoSuchElementException if an empty stack is popped") {
      val emptyStack = new Stack[String]
      intercept[NoSuchElementException] {
        emptyStack.pop()
      }
    }
  }
}
</pre></p><p>If you run this version of <code>StackSpec</code> with:</p><p><pre>
scala> (new StackSpec).execute()
</pre></p><p>It will run only the second test and report that the first test was ignored:</p><p><pre>
A Stack
- should pop values in last-in-first-out order !!! IGNORED !!!
- should throw NoSuchElementException if an empty stack is popped
</pre></p><h4> Pending tests </h4><p>A <em>pending test</em> is one that has been given a name but is not yet implemented. The purpose of
pending tests is to facilitate a style of testing in which documentation of behavior is sketched
out before tests are written to verify that behavior (and often, the before the behavior of
the system being tested is itself implemented). Such sketches form a kind of specification of
what tests and functionality to implement later.</p><p>To support this style of testing, a test can be given a name that specifies one
bit of behavior required by the system being tested. The test can also include some code that
sends more information about the behavior to the reporter when the tests run. At the end of the test,
it can call method <code>pending</code>, which will cause it to complete abruptly with <code>TestPendingException</code>.
Because tests in ScalaTest can be designated as pending with <code>TestPendingException</code>, both the test name and any information
sent to the reporter when running the test can appear in the report of a test run. (In other words,
the code of a pending test is executed just like any other test.) However, because the test completes abruptly
with <code>TestPendingException</code>, the test will be reported as pending, to indicate
the actual test, and possibly the functionality, has not yet been implemented.</p><p>You can mark a test as pending in <code>Spec</code> by placing &quot;<code>(pending)</code>&quot; after the
test name, like this:</p><p><pre>
import org.scalatest.Spec
import scala.collection.mutable.Stack

class StackSpec extends Spec {

  describe("A Stack") {

    it("should pop values in last-in-first-out order") {
      val stack = new Stack[Int]
      stack.push(1)
      stack.push(2)
      assert(stack.pop() === 2)
      assert(stack.pop() === 1)
    }

    it("should throw NoSuchElementException if an empty stack is popped") (pending)
  }
}
</pre></p><p>(Note: &quot;<code>(pending)</code>&quot; is the body of the test. Thus the test contains just one statement, an invocation
of the <code>pending</code> method, which throws <code>TestPendingException</code>.)
If you run this version of <code>StackSpec</code> with:</p><p><pre>
scala> (new StackSpec).execute()
</pre></p><p>It will run both tests, but report that the test named &quot;<code>A stack should pop values in last-in-first-out order</code>&quot; is pending. You'll see:</p><p><pre>
A Stack
- should pop values in last-in-first-out order
- should throw NoSuchElementException if an empty stack is popped (pending)
</pre>

assertions with <code>===</code> comparisons.</p><p>For more information
on this mechanism, see the <a href="Suite.Equalizer.html">documentation for </code>Equalizer</code></a>.</p><p>Because trait <code>Suite</code> mixes in <code>Assertions</code>, this implicit conversion will always be
available by default in ScalaTest <code>Suite</code>s. This is the only implicit conversion that is in scope by default in every
ScalaTest <code>Suite</code>. Other implicit conversions offered by ScalaTest, such as those that support the matchers DSL
or <code>invokePrivate</code>, must be explicitly invited into your test code, either by mixing in a trait or importing the
members of its companion object. The reason ScalaTest requires you to invite in implicit conversions (with the exception of the
implicit conversion for <code>===</code> operator)  is because if one of ScalaTest's implicit conversions clashes with an
implicit conversion used in the code you are trying to test, your program won't compile. Thus there is a chance that if you
are ever trying to use a library or test some code that also offers an implicit conversion involving a <code>===</code> operator,
you could run into the problem of a compiler error due to an ambiguous implicit conversion. If that happens, you can turn off
the implicit conversion offered by this <code>convertToEqualizer</code> method simply by overriding the method in your
<code>Suite</code> subclass, but not marking it as implicit:</p><p><pre>
// In your Suite subclass

is because <code>junit.framework.TestCase</code> declares a <code>run</code> method
that takes no arguments but returns a <code>junit.framework.TestResult</code>. That
<code>run</code> method would not overload with this method if it were named <code>run</code>,
because it would have the same parameters but a different return type than the one
defined in <code>TestCase</code>. To facilitate integration with JUnit 3, therefore,
these convenience &quot;run&quot; methods are named <code>execute</code>. In particular, this allows trait
<code>org.scalatest.junit.JUnit3Suite</code> to extend both <code>org.scalatest.Suite</code> and
<code>junit.framework.TestCase</code>, which enables the creating of classes that
can be run with either ScalaTest or JUnit 3.</p></div><dl class="attributes block"> <dt>Attributes</dt><dd>final </dd><dt>Definition Classes</dt><dd><a name="org.scalatest.Suite" class="extype" href="Suite.html">Suite</a></dd></dl></div>

The purpose of
pending tests is to facilitate a style of testing in which documentation of behavior is sketched
out before tests are written to verify that behavior (and often, the before the behavior of
the system being tested is itself implemented). Such sketches form a kind of specification of
what tests and functionality to implement later.</p><p>To support this style of testing, a test can be given a name that specifies one
bit of behavior required by the system being tested. The test can also include some code that
sends more information about the behavior to the reporter when the tests run. At the end of the test,
it can call method <code>pending</code>, which will cause it to complete abruptly with <code>TestPendingException</code>.
Because tests in ScalaTest can be designated as pending with <code>TestPendingException</code>, both the test name and any information
sent to the reporter when running the test can appear in the report of a test run. (In other words,
the code of a pending test is executed just like any other test.) However, because the test completes abruptly
with <code>TestPendingException</code>, the test will be reported as pending, to indicate
the actual test, and possibly the functionality it is intended to test, has not yet been implemented.</p><p>Note: This method always completes abruptly with a <code>TestPendingException</code>. Thus it always has a side
effect. Methods with side effects are usually invoked with parentheses, as in <code>pending()</code>. This
method is defined as a parameterless method, in flagrant contradiction to recommended Scala style, because it
forms a kind of DSL for pending tests. It enables tests in suites such as <code>FunSuite</code> or <code>Spec</code>
to be denoted by placing &quot;<code>(pending)</code>&quot; after the test name, as in:</p><p><pre>
test("that style rules are not laws") (pending)
</pre></p><p>Readers of the code see &quot;pending&quot; in parentheses, which looks like a little note attached to the test name to indicate
it is pending. Whereas &quot;<code>(pending())</code> looks more like a method call, &quot;<code>(pending)</code>&quot; lets readers
stay at a higher level, forgetting how it is implemented and just focusing on the intent of the programmer who wrote the code.</p></div><dl class="attributes block"> <dt>Definition Classes</dt><dd><a name="org.scalatest.Suite" class="extype" href="Suite.html">Suite</a></dd></dl></div>

automatically turn back into a failing test once the problem originally causing the test to fail has been fixed.
At that point, you need only remove the <code>pendingUntilFixed</code> call. In other words, a
<code>pendingUntilFixed</code> surrounding a block of code that isn't broken is treated as a test failure.
The motivation for this behavior is to encourage people to remove <code>pendingUntilFixed</code> calls when
there are no longer needed.</p><p>This method facilitates a style of testing in which tests are written before the code they test. Sometimes you may
encounter a test failure that requires more functionality than you want to tackle without writing more tests. In this
case you can mark the bit of test code causing the failure with <code>pendingUntilFixed</code>. You can then write more
tests and functionality that eventually will get your production code to a point where the original test won't fail anymore.
At this point the code block marked with <code>pendingUntilFixed</code> will no longer throw an exception (because the
problem has been fixed). This will in turn cause <code>pendingUntilFixed</code> to throw <code>TestFailedException</code>
with a detail message explaining you need to go back and remove the <code>pendingUntilFixed</code> call as the problem orginally
causing your test code to fail has been fixed.</p></div><dl class="paramcmts block"><dt class="param">f</dt><dd class="cmt"><p>a block of code, which if it completes abruptly, should trigger a <code>TestPendingException</code></p></dd></dl><dl class="attributes block"> <dt>Definition Classes</dt><dd><a name="org.scalatest.Suite" class="extype" href="Suite.html">Suite</a></dd></dl></div>

that subclasses and subtraits that override <code>run</code> in a way that does not

reason for this recommendation is that ScalaTest includes several traits that override
these methods to allow behavior to be mixed into a <code>Suite</code>. For example, trait
<code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> overrides <code>runTests</code>s. In a <code>Suite</code>
subclass that no longer invokes <code>runTests</code> from <code>run</code>, the

By making <code>runTests</code> final in such a <code>Suite</code> subtrait, you make
the attempt to mix <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> into a subclass of your subtrait
a compiler error. (It would fail to compile with a complaint that <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code>
