          <div class="fullcommenttop" id="comment"><div class="comment cmt"><p>A suite of tests. A <code>Suite</code> instance encapsulates a conceptual
suite (<em>i.e.</em>, a collection) of tests.</p><p>This trait provides an interface that allows suites of tests to be run.
Its implementation enables a default way of writing and executing tests.  Subtraits and subclasses can
override <code>Suite</code>'s methods to enable other ways of writing and executing tests.
This trait's default approach allows tests to be defined as methods whose name starts with &quot;<code>test</code>.&quot;
This approach is easy to understand, and a good way for Scala beginners to start writing tests.
More advanced Scala programmers may prefer to mix together other <code>Suite</code> subtraits defined in ScalaTest,
or create their own, to write tests in the way they feel makes them most productive. Here's a quick overview
of some of the options to help you get started:</p><p><em>For JUnit 3 users</em></p><p>If you are using JUnit 3 (version 3.8 or earlier releases) and you want to write JUnit 3 tests in Scala, look at
<a href="junit/AssertionsForJUnit.html"><code>AssertionsForJUnit</code></a>,
<a href="junit/ShouldMatchersForJUnit.html"><code>ShouldMatchersForJUnit</code></a>, and
<a href="junit/JUnit3Suite.html"><code>JUnit3Suite</code></a>.</p><p><em>For JUnit 4 users</em></p><p>If you are using JUnit 4 and you want to write JUnit 4 tests in Scala, look at
<a href="junit/JUnitSuite.html"><code>JUnitSuite</code></a>, and
<a href="junit/JUnitRunner.html"><code>JUnitRunner</code></a>. With <code>JUnitRunner</code>,
you can use any of the traits described here and still run your tests with JUnit 4.</p><p><em>For TestNG users</em></p><p>If you are using TestNG and you want to write TestNG tests in Scala, look at
<a href="testng/TestNGSuite.html"><code>TestNGSuite</code></a>.</p><p><em>For high-level testing</em></p><p>If you want to write tests at a higher level than unit tests, such as integration tests, acceptance tests,
or functional tests, check out <a href="FeatureSpec.html"><code>FeatureSpec</code></a>.</p><p><em>For unit testing</em></p><p>If you prefer a behavior-driven development (BDD) style, in which tests are combined with text that
specifies the behavior being tested, look at
<a href="Spec.html"><code>Spec</code></a>,
<a href="FlatSpec.html"><code>FlatSpec</code></a>, and
<a href="WordSpec.html"><code>WordSpec</code></a>. Otherwise, if you just want to write tests
and don't want to combine testing with specifying, look at
<a href="FunSuite.html"><code>FunSuite</code></a> or read on to learn how to write
tests using this base trait, <code>Suite</code>.</p><p>To use this trait's approach to writing tests, simply create classes that
extend <code>Suite</code> and define test methods. Test methods have names of the form <code>testX</code>,
where <code>X</code> is some unique, hopefully meaningful, string. A test method must be public and
can have any result type, but the most common result type is <code>Unit</code>. Here's an example:</p><p><pre>
import org.scalatest.Suite

class MySuite extends Suite {

  def testAddition() {
    val sum = 1 + 1
    assert(sum === 2)
    assert(sum + 2 === 4)
  }

  def testSubtraction() {
    val diff = 4 - 1
    assert(diff === 3)
    assert(diff - 2 === 1)
  }
}
</pre></p><p>You can run a <code>Suite</code> by invoking on it one of four overloaded <code>execute</code>
methods. These methods, which print test results to the
standard output, are intended to serve as a
convenient way to run tests from within the Scala interpreter. For example,
to run <code>MySuite</code> from within the Scala interpreter, you could write:</p><p><pre>
scala> (new MySuite).execute()
</pre></p><p>And you would see:</p><p><pre>
Test Starting - MySuite: testAddition
Test Succeeded - MySuite: testAddition
Test Starting - MySuite: testSubtraction
Test Succeeded - MySuite: testSubtraction
</pre></p><p>Or, to run just the <code>testAddition</code> method, you could write:</p><p><pre>
scala> (new MySuite).execute("testAddition")
</pre></p><p>And you would see:</p><p><pre>
Test Starting - MySuite: testAddition
Test Succeeded - MySuite: testAddition
</pre></p><p>Two other <code>execute</code> methods that are intended to be run from the interpreter accept a &quot;config&quot; map of key-value
pairs (see <a href="#configMapSection">Config map</a>, below). Each of these <code>execute</code> methods invokes a <code>run</code> method takes seven
parameters. This <code>run</code> method, which actually executes the suite, will usually be invoked by a test runner, such
as <code>org.scalatest.tools.Runner</code> or an IDE. See the <a href="tools/Runner$.html">documentation
for <code>Runner</code></a> for more detail.</p><h4> Assertions and </h4><p>Inside test methods in a <code>Suite</code>, you can write assertions by invoking <code>assert</code> and passing in a <code>Boolean</code> expression,
such as:</p><p><pre>
val left = 2
val right = 1
assert(left == right)
</pre></p><p>If the passed expression is <code>true</code>, <code>assert</code> will return normally. If <code>false</code>,
<code>assert</code> will complete abruptly with a <code>TestFailedException</code>. This exception is usually not caught
by the test method, which means the test method itself will complete abruptly by throwing the <code>TestFailedException</code>. Any
test method that completes abruptly with a <code>TestFailedException</code> or any <code>Exception</code> is considered a failed
test. A test method that returns normally is considered a successful test.</p><p>If you pass a <code>Boolean</code> expression to <code>assert</code>, a failed assertion will be reported, but without
reporting the left and right values. You can alternatively encode these values in a <code>String</code> passed as
a second argument to <code>assert</code>, as in:</p><p><pre>
val left = 2
val right = 1
assert(left == right, left + " did not equal " + right)
</pre></p><p>Using this form of <code>assert</code>, the failure report will include the left and right values, thereby
helping you debug the problem. However, ScalaTest provides the <code>===</code> operator to make this easier.
(The <code>===</code> operator is defined in trait <a href="Assertions.html"><code>Assertions</code></a> which trait <code>Suite</code> extends.)
You use it like this:</p><p><pre>
val left = 2
val right = 1
assert(left === right)
</pre></p><p>Because you use <code>===</code> here instead of <code>==</code>, the failure report will include the left
and right values. For example, the detail message in the thrown <code>TestFailedException</code> from the <code>assert</code>
shown previously will include, &quot;2 did not equal 1&quot;.
From this message you will know that the operand on the left had the value 2, and the operand on the right had the value 1.</p><p>If you're familiar with JUnit, you would use <code>===</code>
in a ScalaTest <code>Suite</code> where you'd use <code>assertEquals</code> in a JUnit <code>TestCase</code>.
The <code>===</code> operator is made possible by an implicit conversion from <code>Any</code>
to <code>Equalizer</code>. If you're curious to understand the mechanics, see the <a href="Assertions$Equalizer.html">documentation for
<code>Equalizer</code></a> and the <code>convertToEqualizer</code> method.</p><h4> Expected results </h4><p>Although <code>===</code> provides a natural, readable extension to Scala's <code>assert</code> mechanism,
as the operands become lengthy, the code becomes less readable. In addition, the <code>===</code> comparison
doesn't distinguish between actual and expected values. The operands are just called <code>left</code> and <code>right</code>,
because if one were named <code>expected</code> and the other <code>actual</code>, it would be difficult for people to
remember which was which. To help with these limitations of assertions, <code>Suite</code> includes a method called <code>expect</code> that
can be used as an alternative to <code>assert</code> with <code>===</code>. To use <code>expect</code>, you place
the expected value in parentheses after <code>expect</code>, followed by curly braces containing code
that should result in the expected value. For example:</p><p><pre>
val a = 5
val b = 2
expect(2) {
  a - b
}
</pre></p><p>In this case, the expected value is <code>2</code>, and the code being tested is <code>a - b</code>. This expectation will fail, and
the detail message in the <code>TestFailedException</code> will read, &quot;Expected 2, but got 3.&quot;</p><h4> Intercepted exceptions </h4><p>Sometimes you need to test whether a method throws an expected exception under certain circumstances, such
as when invalid arguments are passed to the method. You can do this in the JUnit style, like this:</p><p><pre>
val s = "hi"
try {
  s.charAt(-1)
  fail()
}
catch {
  case _: IndexOutOfBoundsException => // Expected, so continue
}
</pre></p><p>If <code>charAt</code> throws <code>IndexOutOfBoundsException</code> as expected, control will transfer
to the catch case, which does nothing. If, however, <code>charAt</code> fails to throw an exception,
the next statement, <code>fail()</code>, will be executed. The <code>fail</code> method always completes abruptly with
a <code>TestFailedException</code>, thereby signaling a failed test.</p><p>To make this common use case easier to express and read, ScalaTest provides an <code>intercept</code>
method. You use it like this:</p><p><pre>
val s = "hi"
intercept[IndexOutOfBoundsException] {
  s.charAt(-1)
}
</pre></p><p>This code behaves much like the previous example. If <code>charAt</code> throws an instance of <code>IndexOutOfBoundsException</code>,
<code>intercept</code> will return that exception. But if <code>charAt</code> completes normally, or throws a different
exception, <code>intercept</code> will complete abruptly with a <code>TestFailedException</code>. The <code>intercept</code> method returns the
caught exception so that you can inspect it further if you wish, for example, to ensure that data contained inside
the exception has the expected values. Here's an example:</p><p><pre>
val s = "hi"
val caught =
  intercept[IndexOutOfBoundsException] {
    s.charAt(-1)
  }
assert(caught.getMessage === "String index out of range: -1")
</pre></p><h4> Using other assertions </h4><p>ScalaTest also supports another style of assertions via its matchers DSL. By mixing in
trait <a href="matchers/ShouldMatchers.html"><code>ShouldMatchers</code></a>, you can
write suites that look like:</p><p><pre>
import org.scalatest.Suite
import org.scalatest.matchers.ShouldMatchers

class MySuite extends Suite with ShouldMatchers {

  def testAddition() {
    val sum = 1 + 1
    sum should equal (2)
    sum + 2 should equal (4)
  }

  def testSubtraction() {
    val diff = 4 - 1
    diff should equal (3)
    diff - 2 should equal (1)
  }
}
</pre></p><p>If you prefer the word &quot;<code>must</code>&quot; to the word &quot;<code>should</code>,&quot; you can alternatively mix in
trait <a href="matchers/MustMatchers.html"><code>MustMatchers</code></a>.</p><p>If you are comfortable with assertion mechanisms from other test frameworks, chances
are you can use them with ScalaTest. Any assertion mechanism that indicates a failure with an exception
can be used as is with ScalaTest. For example, to use the <code>assertEquals</code>
methods provided by JUnit or TestNG, simply import them and use them. (You will of course need
to include the relevant JAR file for the framework whose assertions you want to use on either the
classpath or runpath when you run your tests.) Here's an example in which JUnit's assertions are
imported, then used within a ScalaTest suite:</p><p><pre>
import org.scalatest.Suite
import org.junit.Assert._

class MySuite extends Suite {

  def testAddition() {
    val sum = 1 + 1
    assertEquals(2, sum)
    assertEquals(4, sum + 2)
  }

  def testSubtraction() {
    val diff = 4 - 1
    assertEquals(3, diff)
    assertEquals(1, diff - 2)
  }
}
</pre></p><h4> Nested suites </h4><p>A <code>Suite</code> can refer to a collection of other <code>Suite</code>s,
which are called <em>nested</em> <code>Suite</code>s. Those nested  <code>Suite</code>s can in turn have
their own nested  <code>Suite</code>s, and so on. Large test suites can be organized, therefore, as a tree of
nested <code>Suite</code>s.
This trait's <code>run</code> method, in addition to invoking its
test methods, invokes <code>run</code> on each of its nested <code>Suite</code>s.</p><p>A <code>List</code> of a <code>Suite</code>'s nested <code>Suite</code>s can be obtained by invoking its
<code>nestedSuites</code> method. If you wish to create a <code>Suite</code> that serves as a
container for nested <code>Suite</code>s, whether or not it has test methods of its own, simply override <code>nestedSuites</code>
to return a <code>List</code> of the nested <code>Suite</code>s. Because this is a common use case, ScalaTest provides
a convenience <code>SuperSuite</code> class, which takes a <code>List</code> of nested <code>Suite</code>s as a constructor
parameter. Here's an example:</p><p><pre>
import org.scalatest.Suite

class ASuite extends Suite
class BSuite extends Suite
class CSuite extends Suite

class AlphabetSuite extends SuperSuite(
  List(
    new ASuite,
    new BSuite,
    new CSuite
  )
)
</pre></p><p>If you now run <code>AlphabetSuite</code>, for example from the interpreter:</p><p><pre>
scala> (new AlphabetSuite).run()
</pre></p><p>You will see reports printed to the standard output that indicate nested
suites&#8212;<code>ASuite</code>, <code>BSuite</code>, and
<code>CSuite</code>&#8212;were run.</p><p>Note that <code>Runner</code> can discover <code>Suite</code>s automatically, so you need not
necessarily specify <code>SuperSuite</code>s explicitly. See the <a href="tools/Runner$.html">documentation
for <code>Runner</code></a> for more information.</p><h4> Shared fixtures </h4><p>A test <em>fixture</em> is objects or other artifacts (such as files, sockets, database
connections, etc.) used by tests to do their work.
If a fixture is used by only one test method, then the definitions of the fixture objects can
be local to the method, such as the objects assigned to <code>sum</code> and <code>diff</code> in the
previous <code>MySuite</code> examples. If multiple methods need to share an immutable fixture, one approach
is to assign them to instance variables. Here's a (very contrived) example, in which the object assigned
to <code>shared</code> is used by multiple test methods:</p><p><pre>
import org.scalatest.Suite

class MySuite extends Suite {

  // Sharing immutable fixture objects via instance variables
  val shared = 5

  def testAddition() {
    val sum = 2 + 3
    assert(sum === shared)
  }

  def testSubtraction() {
    val diff = 7 - 2
    assert(diff === shared)
  }
}
</pre></p><p>In some cases, however, shared <em>mutable</em> fixture objects may be changed by test methods such that
they need to be recreated or reinitialized before each test. Shared resources such
as files or database connections may also need to
be created and initialized before, and cleaned up after, each test. JUnit 3 offers methods <code>setUp</code> and
<code>tearDown</code> for this purpose. In ScalaTest, you can use the <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> trait,
which will be described later, to implement an approach similar to JUnit's <code>setUp</code>
and <code>tearDown</code>, however, this approach usually involves reassigning <code>var</code>s
between tests. Before going that route, you may wish to consider some approaches that
avoid <code>var</code>s. One approach is to write one or more <em>create-fixture</em> methods
that return a new instance of a needed object (or a tuple or case class holding new instances of
multiple objects) each time it is called. You can then call a create-fixture method at the beginning of each
test method that needs the fixture, storing the fixture object or objects in local variables. Here's an example:</p><p><pre>
import org.scalatest.Suite
import scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer

class MySuite extends Suite {

  // create objects needed by tests and return as a tuple
  def createFixture = (
    new StringBuilder("ScalaTest is "),
    new ListBuffer[String]
  )

  def testEasy() {
    val (builder, lbuf) = createFixture
    builder.append("easy!")
    assert(builder.toString === "ScalaTest is easy!")
    assert(lbuf.isEmpty)
    lbuf += "sweet"
  }

  def testFun() {
    val (builder, lbuf) = createFixture
    builder.append("fun!")
    assert(builder.toString === "ScalaTest is fun!")
    assert(lbuf.isEmpty)
  }
}
</pre></p><p>If different tests in the same <code>Suite</code> require different fixtures, you can create multiple create-fixture methods and
call the method (or methods) needed by each test at the begining of the test. If every test method requires the same set of
mutable fixture objects, one other approach you can take is make them simply <code>val</code>s and mix in trait
<a href="OneInstancePerTest.html"><code>OneInstancePerTest</code></a>.  If you mix in <code>OneInstancePerTest</code>, each test
will be run in its own instance of the <code>Suite</code>, similar to the way JUnit tests are executed.</p><p>Although the create-fixture and <code>OneInstancePerTest</code> approaches take care of setting up a fixture before each
test, they don't address the problem of cleaning up a fixture after the test completes. In this situation,
one option is to mix in the <a href="BeforeAndAfterEach.html"><code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code></a> trait.
<code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code>'s <code>beforeEach</code> method will be run before, and its <code>afterEach</code>
method after, each test (like JUnit's <code>setUp</code>  and <code>tearDown</code>
methods, respectively).
For example, you could create a temporary file before each test, and delete it afterwords, like this:</p><p><pre>
import org.scalatest.Suite
import org.scalatest.BeforeAndAfterEach
import java.io.FileReader
import java.io.FileWriter
import java.io.File

class MySuite extends Suite with BeforeAndAfterEach {

  private val FileName = "TempFile.txt"
  private var reader: FileReader = _

  // Set up the temp file needed by the test
  override def beforeEach() {
    val writer = new FileWriter(FileName)
    try {
      writer.write("Hello, test!")
    }
    finally {
      writer.close()
    }

    // Create the reader needed by the test
    reader = new FileReader(FileName)
  }

  // Close and delete the temp file
  override def afterEach() {
    reader.close()
    val file = new File(FileName)
    file.delete()
  }

  def testReadingFromTheTempFile() {
    var builder = new StringBuilder
    var c = reader.read()
    while (c != -1) {
      builder.append(c.toChar)
      c = reader.read()
    }
    assert(builder.toString === "Hello, test!")
  }

  def testFirstCharOfTheTempFile() {
    assert(reader.read() === 'H')
  }

  def testWithoutAFixture() {
    assert(1 + 1 === 2)
  }
}
</pre></p><p>In this example, the instance variable <code>reader</code> is a <code>var</code>, so
it can be reinitialized between tests by the <code>beforeEach</code> method.</p><p>Although the <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> approach should be familiar to the users of most
test other frameworks, ScalaTest provides another alternative that also allows you to perform cleanup
after each test: overriding <code>withFixture(NoArgTest)</code>.
To execute each test, <code>Suite</code>'s implementation of the <code>runTest</code> method wraps an invocation
of the appropriate test method in a no-arg function. <code>runTest</code> passes that test function to the <code>withFixture(NoArgTest)</code>
method, which is responsible for actually running the test by invoking the function. <code>Suite</code>'s
implementation of <code>withFixture(NoArgTest)</code> simply invokes the function, like this:</p><p><pre>
// Default implementation
protected def withFixture(test: NoArgTest) {
  test()
}
</pre></p><p>The <code>withFixture(NoArgTest)</code> method exists so that you can override it and set a fixture up before, and clean it up after, each test.
Thus, the previous temp file example could also be implemented without mixing in <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code>, like this:</p><p><pre>
import org.scalatest.Suite
import java.io.FileReader
import java.io.FileWriter
import java.io.File

class MySuite extends Suite {

  private var reader: FileReader = _

  override def withFixture(test: NoArgTest) {

    val FileName = "TempFile.txt"

    // Set up the temp file needed by the test
    val writer = new FileWriter(FileName)
    try {
      writer.write("Hello, test!")
    }
    finally {
      writer.close()
    }

    // Create the reader needed by the test
    reader = new FileReader(FileName)

    try {
      test() // Invoke the test function
    }
    finally {
      // Close and delete the temp file
      reader.close()
      val file = new File(FileName)
      file.delete()
    }
  }

  def testReadingFromTheTempFile() {
    var builder = new StringBuilder
    var c = reader.read()
    while (c != -1) {
      builder.append(c.toChar)
      c = reader.read()
    }
    assert(builder.toString === "Hello, test!")
  }

  def testFirstCharOfTheTempFile() {
    assert(reader.read() === 'H')
  }

  def testWithoutAFixture() {
    assert(1 + 1 === 2)
  }
}
</pre></p><p>If you prefer to keep your test classes immutable, one final variation is to use the
<a href="fixture/FixtureSuite.html"><code>FixtureSuite</code></a> trait from the
<code>org.scalatest.fixture</code> package.  Tests in an <code>org.scalatest.fixture.FixtureSuite</code> can have a fixture
object passed in as a parameter. You must indicate the type of the fixture object
by defining the <code>Fixture</code> type member and define a <code>withFixture</code> method that takes a <em>one-arg</em> test function.
(A <code>FixtureSuite</code> has two overloaded <code>withFixture</code> methods, therefore, one that takes a <code>OneArgTest</code>
and the other, inherited from <code>Suite</code>, that takes a <code>NoArgTest</code>.)
Inside the <code>withFixture(OneArgTest)</code> method, you create the fixture, pass it into the test function, then perform any
necessary cleanup after the test function returns. Instead of invoking each test directly, a <code>FixtureSuite</code> will
pass a function that invokes the code of a test to <code>withFixture(OneArgTest)</code>. Your <code>withFixture(OneArgTest)</code> method, therefore,
is responsible for actually running the code of the test by invoking the test function.
For example, you could pass the temp file reader fixture to each test that needs it
by overriding the <code>withFixture(OneArgTest)</code> method of a <code>FixtureSuite</code>, like this:</p><p><pre>
import org.scalatest.fixture.FixtureSuite
import java.io.FileReader
import java.io.FileWriter
import java.io.File

class MySuite extends FixtureSuite {

  // No vars needed in this one

  type FixtureParam = FileReader

  def withFixture(test: OneArgTest) {

    val FileName = "TempFile.txt"

    // Set up the temp file needed by the test
    val writer = new FileWriter(FileName)
    try {
      writer.write("Hello, test!")
    }
    finally {
      writer.close()
    }

    // Create the reader needed by the test
    val reader = new FileReader(FileName)

    try {
      // Run the test, passing in the temp file reader
      test(reader)
    }
    finally {
      // Close and delete the temp file
      reader.close()
      val file = new File(FileName)
      file.delete()
    }
  }

  def testReadingFromTheTempFile(reader: FileReader) {
    var builder = new StringBuilder
    var c = reader.read()
    while (c != -1) {
      builder.append(c.toChar)
      c = reader.read()
    }
    assert(builder.toString === "Hello, test!")
  }

  def testFirstCharOfTheTempFile(reader: FileReader) {
    assert(reader.read() === 'H')
  }

  def testWithoutAFixture() {
    assert(1 + 1 === 2)
  }
}
</pre></p><p>It is worth noting that the only difference in the test code between the mutable
<code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> approach shown previously and the immutable <code>FixtureSuite</code>
approach shown here is that two of the <code>FixtureSuite</code>'s test methods take a <code>FileReader</code> as
a parameter. Otherwise the test code is identical. One benefit of the explicit parameter is that, as demonstrated
by the <code>testWithoutAFixture</code> method, a <code>FixtureSuite</code>
test method need not take the fixture. (Tests that don't take a fixture as a parameter are passed to the <code>withFixture</code>
that takes a <code>NoArgTest</code>, shown previously.) So you can have some tests that take a fixture, and others that don't.
In this case, the <code>FixtureSuite</code> provides documentation indicating which
test methods use the fixture and which don't, whereas the <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> approach does not.</p><p>If you want to execute code before and after all tests (and nested suites) in a suite, such
as you could do with <code>@BeforeClass</code> and <code>@AfterClass</code>
annotations in JUnit 4, you can use the <code>beforeAll</code> and <code>afterAll</code>
methods of <code>BeforeAndAfterAll</code>. See the documentation for <code>BeforeAndAfterAll</code> for
an example.</p><p><a name="configMapSection"> </a></p><h4> The config map </h4><p>In some cases you may need to pass information to a suite of tests.
For example, perhaps a suite of tests needs to grab information from a file, and you want
to be able to specify a different filename during different runs.  You can accomplish this in ScalaTest by passing
the filename in the <em>config</em> map of key-value pairs, which is passed to <code>run</code> as a <code>Map[String, Any]</code>.
The values in the config map are called &quot;config objects,&quot; because they can be used to <em>configure</em>
suites, reporters, and tests.</p><p>You can specify a string config object is via the ScalaTest <code>Runner</code>, either via the command line
or ScalaTest's ant task.
(See the <a href="tools/Runner$.html#configMapSection">documentation for Runner</a> for information on how to specify
config objects on the command line.)
The config map is passed to <code>run</code>, <code>runNestedSuites</code>, <code>runTests</code>, and <code>runTest</code>,
so one way to access it in your suite is to override one of those methods. If you need to use the config map inside your tests, you
can use one of the traits in the <code>org.scalatest.fixture</code>  package. (See the
<a href="fixture/FixtureSuite.html">documentation for <code>FixtureSuite</code></a>
for instructions on how to access the config map in tests.)</p><p><a name="TaggingTests"> </a></p><h4> Tagging tests </h4><p>A <code>Suite</code>'s tests may be classified into groups by <em>tagging</em> them with string names. When executing
a <code>Suite</code>, groups of tests can optionally be included and/or excluded. In this
trait's implementation, tags are indicated by annotations attached to the test method. To
create a new tag type to use in <code>Suite</code>s, simply define a new Java annotation that itself is annotated with the <code>org.scalatest.TagAnnotation</code> annotation.
(Currently, for annotations to be
visible in Scala programs via Java reflection, the annotations themselves must be written in Java.) For example,
to create a tag named <code>SlowAsMolasses</code>, to use to mark slow tests, you would
write in Java:</p><p><b>BECAUSE OF A SCALADOC BUG IN SCALA 2.8, I HAD TO PUT A SPACE AFTER THE AT SIGN IN ONE THE TARGET ANNOTATION EXAMPLE BELOW. IF YOU
WANT TO COPY AND PASTE FROM THIS EXAMPLE, YOU'LL NEED TO REMOVE THE SPACE BY HAND, OR COPY FROM
THE <a href="http://www.scalatest.org/scaladoc/doc-1.1/org/scalatest/Suite.html">SUITE SCALADOC FOR VERSION 1.1</a> INSTEAD, WHICH IS ALSO VALID FOR 1.3. - Bill Venners</b></p><p><pre>
import java.lang.annotation.*;
import org.scalatest.TagAnnotation

@TagAnnotation
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@ Target({ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.TYPE})
public @interface SlowAsMolasses {}
</pre></p><p>Given this new annotation, you could place a <code>Suite</code> test method into the <code>SlowAsMolasses</code> group
(<em>i.e.</em>, tag it as being <code>SlowAsMolasses</code>) like this:</p><p><pre>
@SlowAsMolasses
def testSleeping() = sleep(1000000)
</pre></p><p>The primary <code>run</code> method takes a <code>Filter</code>, whose constructor takes an optional
<code>Set[String]</code>s called <code>tagsToInclude</code> and a <code>Set[String]</code> called
<code>tagsToExclude</code>. If <code>tagsToInclude</code> is <code>None</code>, all tests will be run
except those those belonging to tags listed in the
<code>tagsToExclude</code> <code>Set</code>. If <code>tagsToInclude</code> is defined, only tests
belonging to tags mentioned in the <code>tagsToInclude</code> set, and not mentioned in <code>tagsToExclude</code>,
will be run.</p><h4> Ignored tests </h4><p>Another common use case is that tests must be &#8220;temporarily&#8221; disabled, with the
good intention of resurrecting the test at a later time. ScalaTest provides an <code>Ignore</code>
annotation for this purpose. You use it like this:</p><p><pre>
import org.scalatest.Suite
import org.scalatest.Ignore

class MySuite extends Suite {

  def testAddition() {
    val sum = 1 + 1
    assert(sum === 2)
    assert(sum + 2 === 4)
  }

  @Ignore
  def testSubtraction() {
    val diff = 4 - 1
    assert(diff === 3)
    assert(diff - 2 === 1)
  }
}
</pre></p><p>If you run this version of <code>MySuite</code> with:</p><p><pre>
scala> (new MySuite).run()
</pre></p><p>It will run only <code>testAddition</code> and report that <code>testSubtraction</code> was ignored. You'll see:</p><p><pre>
Test Starting - MySuite: testAddition
Test Succeeded - MySuite: testAddition
Test Ignored - MySuite: testSubtraction
</pre></p><p><code>Ignore</code> is implemented as a tag. The <code>Filter</code> class effectively
adds <code>org.scalatest.Ignore</code> to the <code>tagsToExclude</code> <code>Set</code> if it not already
in the <code>tagsToExclude</code> set passed to its primary constructor.  The only difference between
<code>org.scalatest.Ignore</code> and the tags you may define and exclude is that ScalaTest reports
ignored tests to the <code>Reporter</code>. The reason ScalaTest reports ignored tests is as a feeble
attempt to encourage ignored tests to be eventually fixed and added back into the active suite of tests.</p><h4> Pending tests </h4><p>A <em>pending test</em> is one that has been given a name but is not yet implemented. The purpose of
pending tests is to facilitate a style of testing in which documentation of behavior is sketched
out before tests are written to verify that behavior (and often, the before the behavior of
the system being tested is itself implemented). Such sketches form a kind of specification of
what tests and functionality to implement later.</p><p>To support this style of testing, a test can be given a name that specifies one
bit of behavior required by the system being tested. The test can also include some code that
sends more information about the behavior to the reporter when the tests run. At the end of the test,
it can call method <code>pending</code>, which will cause it to complete abruptly with <code>TestPendingException</code>.
Because tests in ScalaTest can be designated as pending with <code>TestPendingException</code>, both the test name and any information
sent to the reporter when running the test can appear in the report of a test run. (In other words,
the code of a pending test is executed just like any other test.) However, because the test completes abruptly
with <code>TestPendingException</code>, the test will be reported as pending, to indicate
the actual test, and possibly the functionality it is intended to test, has not yet been implemented.</p><p>Although pending tests may be used more often in specification-style suites, such as
<code>org.scalatest.Spec</code>, you can also use it in <code>Suite</code>, like this:</p><p><pre>
import org.scalatest.Suite

class MySuite extends Suite {

  def testAddition() {
    val sum = 1 + 1
    assert(sum === 2)
    assert(sum + 2 === 4)
  }

  def testSubtraction() { pending }
}
</pre></p><p>If you run this version of <code>MySuite</code> with:</p><p><pre>
scala> (new MySuite).run()
</pre></p><p>It will run both tests but report that <code>testSubtraction</code> is pending. You'll see:</p><p><pre>
Test Starting - MySuite: testAddition
Test Succeeded - MySuite: testAddition
Test Starting - MySuite: testSubtraction
Test Pending - MySuite: testSubtraction
</pre></p><h4> Informers </h4><p>One of the parameters to the primary <code>run</code> method is an <code>Reporter</code>, which
will collect and report information about the running suite of tests.
Information about suites and tests that were run, whether tests succeeded or failed,
and tests that were ignored will be passed to the <code>Reporter</code> as the suite runs.
Most often the reporting done by default by <code>Suite</code>'s methods will be sufficient, but
occasionally you may wish to provide custom information to the <code>Reporter</code> from a test method.
For this purpose, you can optionally include an <code>Informer</code> parameter in a test method, and then
pass the extra information to the <code>Informer</code> via its <code>apply</code> method. The <code>Informer</code>
will then pass the information to the <code>Reporter</code> by sending an <code>InfoProvided</code> event.
Here's an example:</p><p><pre>
import org.scalatest._

class MySuite extends Suite {
  def testAddition(info: Informer) {
    assert(1 + 1 === 2)
    info("Addition seems to work")
  }
}
</pre></p><p>If you run this <code>Suite</code> from the interpreter, you will see the message
included in the printed report:</p><p><pre>
scala> (new MySuite).run()
Test Starting - MySuite: testAddition(Reporter)
Info Provided - MySuite: testAddition(Reporter)
  Addition seems to work
Test Succeeded - MySuite: testAddition(Reporter)
</pre></p><h4> Executing suites in parallel </h4><p>The primary <code>run</code> method takes as its last parameter an optional <code>Distributor</code>. If
a <code>Distributor</code> is passed in, this trait's implementation of <code>run</code> puts its nested
<code>Suite</code>s into the distributor rather than executing them directly. The caller of <code>run</code>
is responsible for ensuring that some entity runs the <code>Suite</code>s placed into the
distributor. The <code>-c</code> command line parameter to <code>Runner</code>, for example, will cause
<code>Suite</code>s put into the <code>Distributor</code> to be run in parallel via a pool of threads.</p><h4> Treatement of <code>java.lang.Error</code>s </h4><p>The Javadoc documentation for <code>java.lang.Error</code> states:</p><p><blockquote>
An <code>Error</code> is a subclass of <code>Throwable</code> that indicates serious problems that a reasonable application should not try to catch. Most
such errors are abnormal conditions.
</blockquote></p><p>Because <code>Error</code>s are used to denote serious errors, trait <code>Suite</code> and its subtypes in the ScalaTest API do not always treat a test
that completes abruptly with an <code>Error</code> as a test failure, but sometimes as an indication that serious problems
have arisen that should cause the run to abort. For example, if a test completes abruptly with an <code>OutOfMemoryError</code>,
it will not be reported as a test failure, but will instead cause the run to abort. Because not everyone uses <code>Error</code>s only to represent serious
problems, however, ScalaTest only behaves this way for the following exception types (and their subclasses):</p><ul><li><code>java.lang.annotation.AnnotationFormatError</code></li><li><code>java.awt.AWTError</code></li><li><code>java.nio.charset.CoderMalfunctionError</code></li><li><code>javax.xml.parsers.FactoryConfigurationError</code></li><li><code>java.lang.LinkageError</code></li><li><code>java.lang.ThreadDeath</code></li><li><code>javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactoryConfigurationError</code></li><li><code>java.lang.VirtualMachineError</code></li></ul><p>The previous list includes all <code>Error</code>s that exist as part of Java 1.5 API, excluding <code>java.lang.AssertionError</code>. ScalaTest
does treat a thrown <code>AssertionError</code> as an indication of a test failure. In addition, any other <code>Error</code> that is not an instance of a
type mentioned in the previous list will be caught by the <code>Suite</code> traits in the ScalaTest API and reported as the cause of a test failure.</p><p>Although trait <code>Suite</code> and all its subtypes in the ScalaTest API consistently behave this way with regard to <code>Error</code>s,
this behavior is not required by the contract of <code>Suite</code>. Subclasses and subtraits that you define, for example, may treat all
<code>Error</code>s as test failures, or indicate errors in some other way that has nothing to do with exceptions.</p><h4> Extensibility </h4><p>Trait <code>Suite</code> provides default implementations of its methods that should
be sufficient for most applications, but many methods can be overridden when desired. Here's
a summary of the methods that are intended to be overridden:</p><ul><li><code>run</code> - override this method to define custom ways to run suites of
  tests.</li><li><code>runNestedSuites</code> - override this method to define custom ways to run nested suites.</li><li><code>runTests</code> - override this method to define custom ways to run a suite's tests.</li><li><code>runTest</code> - override this method to define custom ways to run a single named test.</li><li><code>testNames</code> - override this method to specify the <code>Suite</code>'s test names in a custom way.</li><li><code>tags</code> - override this method to specify the <code>Suite</code>'s test tags in a custom way.</li><li><code>nestedSuites</code> - override this method to specify the <code>Suite</code>'s nested <code>Suite</code>s in a custom way.</li><li><code>suiteName</code> - override this method to specify the <code>Suite</code>'s name in a custom way.</li><li><code>expectedTestCount</code> - override this method to count this <code>Suite</code>'s expected tests in a custom way.</li></ul><p>For example, this trait's implementation of <code>testNames</code> performs reflection to discover methods starting with <code>test</code>,
and places these in a <code>Set</code> whose iterator returns the names in alphabetical order. If you wish to run tests in a different
order in a particular <code>Suite</code>, perhaps because a test named <code>testAlpha</code> can only succeed after a test named
<code>testBeta</code> has run, you can override <code>testNames</code> so that it returns a <code>Set</code> whose iterator returns
<code>testBeta</code> <em>before</em> <code>testAlpha</code>. (This trait's implementation of <code>run</code> will invoke tests
in the order they come out of the <code>testNames</code> <code>Set</code> iterator.)</p><p>Alternatively, you may not like starting your test methods with <code>test</code>, and prefer using <code>@Test</code> annotations in
the style of Java's JUnit 4 or TestNG. If so, you can override <code>testNames</code> to discover tests using either of these two APIs
<code>@Test</code> annotations, or one of your own invention. (This is in fact
how <code>org.scalatest.junit.JUnitSuite</code> and <code>org.scalatest.testng.TestNGSuite</code> work.)</p><p>Moreover, <em>test</em> in ScalaTest does not necessarily mean <em>test method</em>. A test can be anything that can be given a name,
that starts and either succeeds or fails, and can be ignored. In <code>org.scalatest.FunSuite</code>, for example, tests are represented
as function values. This
approach might look foreign to JUnit users, but may feel more natural to programmers with a functional programming background.
To facilitate this style of writing tests, <code>FunSuite</code> overrides <code>testNames</code>, <code>runTest</code>, and <code>run</code> such that you can
define tests as function values.</p><p>You can also model existing JUnit 3, JUnit 4, or TestNG tests as suites of tests, thereby incorporating tests written in Java into a ScalaTest suite.
The &quot;wrapper&quot; classes in packages <code>org.scalatest.junit</code> and <code>org.scalatest.testng</code> exist to make this easy.
No matter what legacy tests you may have, it is likely you can create or use an existing <code>Suite</code> subclass that allows you to model those tests
as ScalaTest suites and tests and incorporate them into a ScalaTest suite. You can then write new tests in Scala and continue supporting
older tests in Java.</p></div><dl class="attributes block"> <dt>Self Type</dt><dd><a name="org.scalatest.Suite" class="extype" href="">Suite</a></dd><dt>Annotations</dt><dd>

assertions with <code>===</code> comparisons.</p><p>For more information
on this mechanism, see the <a href="Suite.Equalizer.html">documentation for </code>Equalizer</code></a>.</p><p>Because trait <code>Suite</code> mixes in <code>Assertions</code>, this implicit conversion will always be
available by default in ScalaTest <code>Suite</code>s. This is the only implicit conversion that is in scope by default in every
ScalaTest <code>Suite</code>. Other implicit conversions offered by ScalaTest, such as those that support the matchers DSL
or <code>invokePrivate</code>, must be explicitly invited into your test code, either by mixing in a trait or importing the
members of its companion object. The reason ScalaTest requires you to invite in implicit conversions (with the exception of the
implicit conversion for <code>===</code> operator)  is because if one of ScalaTest's implicit conversions clashes with an
implicit conversion used in the code you are trying to test, your program won't compile. Thus there is a chance that if you
are ever trying to use a library or test some code that also offers an implicit conversion involving a <code>===</code> operator,
you could run into the problem of a compiler error due to an ambiguous implicit conversion. If that happens, you can turn off
the implicit conversion offered by this <code>convertToEqualizer</code> method simply by overriding the method in your
<code>Suite</code> subclass, but not marking it as implicit:</p><p><pre>
// In your Suite subclass
override def convertToEqualizer(left: Any) = new Equalizer(left)

that takes no arguments but returns a <code>junit.framework.TestResult</code>. That
<code>run</code> method would not overload with this method if it were named <code>run</code>,
because it would have the same parameters but a different return type than the one
defined in <code>TestCase</code>. To facilitate integration with JUnit 3, therefore,
these convenience &quot;run&quot; methods are named <code>execute</code>. In particular, this allows trait
<code>org.scalatest.junit.JUnit3Suite</code> to extend both <code>org.scalatest.Suite</code> and
<code>junit.framework.TestCase</code>, which enables the creating of classes that

The purpose of
pending tests is to facilitate a style of testing in which documentation of behavior is sketched
out before tests are written to verify that behavior (and often, the before the behavior of
the system being tested is itself implemented). Such sketches form a kind of specification of
what tests and functionality to implement later.</p><p>To support this style of testing, a test can be given a name that specifies one
bit of behavior required by the system being tested. The test can also include some code that
sends more information about the behavior to the reporter when the tests run. At the end of the test,
it can call method <code>pending</code>, which will cause it to complete abruptly with <code>TestPendingException</code>.
Because tests in ScalaTest can be designated as pending with <code>TestPendingException</code>, both the test name and any information
sent to the reporter when running the test can appear in the report of a test run. (In other words,
the code of a pending test is executed just like any other test.) However, because the test completes abruptly
with <code>TestPendingException</code>, the test will be reported as pending, to indicate
the actual test, and possibly the functionality it is intended to test, has not yet been implemented.</p><p>Note: This method always completes abruptly with a <code>TestPendingException</code>. Thus it always has a side
effect. Methods with side effects are usually invoked with parentheses, as in <code>pending()</code>. This
method is defined as a parameterless method, in flagrant contradiction to recommended Scala style, because it
forms a kind of DSL for pending tests. It enables tests in suites such as <code>FunSuite</code> or <code>Spec</code>
to be denoted by placing &quot;<code>(pending)</code>&quot; after the test name, as in:</p><p><pre>
test("that style rules are not laws") (pending)
</pre></p><p>Readers of the code see &quot;pending&quot; in parentheses, which looks like a little note attached to the test name to indicate
it is pending. Whereas &quot;<code>(pending())</code> looks more like a method call, &quot;<code>(pending)</code>&quot; lets readers
stay at a higher level, forgetting how it is implemented and just focusing on the intent of the programmer who wrote the code.</p></div></div>

automatically turn back into a failing test once the problem originally causing the test to fail has been fixed.
At that point, you need only remove the <code>pendingUntilFixed</code> call. In other words, a
<code>pendingUntilFixed</code> surrounding a block of code that isn't broken is treated as a test failure.
The motivation for this behavior is to encourage people to remove <code>pendingUntilFixed</code> calls when
there are no longer needed.</p><p>This method facilitates a style of testing in which tests are written before the code they test. Sometimes you may
encounter a test failure that requires more functionality than you want to tackle without writing more tests. In this
case you can mark the bit of test code causing the failure with <code>pendingUntilFixed</code>. You can then write more
tests and functionality that eventually will get your production code to a point where the original test won't fail anymore.
At this point the code block marked with <code>pendingUntilFixed</code> will no longer throw an exception (because the
problem has been fixed). This will in turn cause <code>pendingUntilFixed</code> to throw <code>TestFailedException</code>
with a detail message explaining you need to go back and remove the <code>pendingUntilFixed</code> call as the problem orginally
causing your test code to fail has been fixed.</p></div><dl class="paramcmts block"><dt class="param">f</dt><dd class="cmt"><p>a block of code, which if it completes abruptly, should trigger a <code>TestPendingException</code></p></dd></dl></div>

is part of the contract of this method. Subclasses that override <code>run</code> must take
care not to call <code>runNestedSuites</code> if <code>testName</code> is defined. (The
<code>OneInstancePerTest</code> trait depends on this behavior, for example.)</p><p>Subclasses and subtraits that override this <code>run</code> method can implement them without
invoking either the <code>runTests</code> or <code>runNestedSuites</code> methods, which
are invoked by this trait's implementation of this method. It is recommended, but not required,
that subclasses and subtraits that override <code>run</code> in a way that does not

final. Similarly it is recommended, but not required,
that subclasses and subtraits that override <code>run</code> in a way that does not

which this trait's implementation of <code>runTests</code> calls) and make it

of the method, or throw an <code>UnsupportedOperationException</code> if appropriate. The
reason for this recommendation is that ScalaTest includes several traits that override
these methods to allow behavior to be mixed into a <code>Suite</code>. For example, trait
<code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> overrides <code>runTests</code>s. In a <code>Suite</code>
subclass that no longer invokes <code>runTests</code> from <code>run</code>, the
<code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> trait is not applicable. Mixing it in would have no effect.
By making <code>runTests</code> final in such a <code>Suite</code> subtrait, you make
the attempt to mix <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> into a subclass of your subtrait
a compiler error. (It would fail to compile with a complaint that <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code>
is trying to override <code>runTests</code>, which is a final method in your trait.)</p></div><dl class="paramcmts block"><dt class="param">testName</dt><dd class="cmt"><p>an optional name of one test to run. If <code>None</code>, all relevant tests should be run.

If <code>testName</code> is defined, this trait's implementation of this method
invokes <code>runTest</code> on this object, passing in:</p><ul><li><code>testName</code> - the <code>String</code> value of the <code>testName</code> <code>Option</code> passed
  to this method</li><li><code>reporter</code> - the <code>Reporter</code> passed to this method, or one that wraps and delegates to it</li><li><code>stopper</code> - the <code>Stopper</code> passed to this method, or one that wraps and delegates to it</li><li><code>configMap</code> - the <code>configMap</code> <code>Map</code> passed to this method, or one that wraps and delegates to it</li></ul><p>This method takes a <code>Filter</code>, which encapsulates an optional <code>Set</code> of tag names that should be included
(<code>tagsToInclude</code>) and a <code>Set</code> that should be excluded (<code>tagsToExclude</code>), when deciding which
of this <code>Suite</code>'s tests to run.
If <code>tagsToInclude</code> is <code>None</code>, all tests will be run
except those those belonging to tags listed in the <code>tagsToExclude</code> <code>Set</code>. If <code>tagsToInclude</code> is defined, only tests
belonging to tags mentioned in the <code>tagsToInclude</code> <code>Set</code>, and not mentioned in the <code>tagsToExclude</code <code>Set</code>
will be run. However, if <code>testName</code> is defined, <code>tagsToInclude</code> and <code>tagsToExclude</code> are essentially ignored.
Only if <code>testName</code> is <code>None</code> will <code>tagsToInclude</code> and <code>tagsToExclude</code> be consulted to
determine which of the tests named in the <code>testNames</code> <code>Set</code> should be run. This trait's implementation
behaves this way, and it is part of the general contract of this method, so all overridden forms of this method should behave
this way as well.  For more information on test tags, see the main documentation for this trait and for class <a href="Filter"><code>Filter</code></a>.
Note that this means that even if a test is marked as ignored, for example a test method in a <code>Suite</code> annotated with
<code>org.scalatest.Ignore</code>, if that test name is passed as <code>testName</code> to <code>runTest</code>, it will be invoked
despite the <code>Ignore</code> annotation.</p><p>If <code>testName</code> is <code>None</code>, this trait's implementation of this method
invokes <code>testNames</code> on this <code>Suite</code> to get a <code>Set</code> of names of tests to potentially run.
(A <code>testNames</code> value of <code>None</code> essentially acts as a wildcard that means all tests in
this <code>Suite</code> that are selected by <code>tagsToInclude</code> and <code>tagsToExclude</code> should be run.)
For each test in the <code>testName</code> <code>Set</code>, in the order
they appear in the iterator obtained by invoking the <code>elements</code> method on the <code>Set</code>, this trait's implementation
of this method checks whether the test should be run based on the <code>Filter</code>.
If so, this implementation invokes <code>runTest</code>, passing in:</p><ul><li><code>testName</code> - the <code>String</code> name of the test to run (which will be one of the names in the <code>testNames</code> <code>Set</code>)</li><li><code>reporter</code> - the <code>Reporter</code> passed to this method, or one that wraps and delegates to it</li><li><code>stopper</code> - the <code>Stopper</code> passed to this method, or one that wraps and delegates to it</li><li><code>configMap</code> - the <code>configMap</code> passed to this method, or one that wraps and delegates to it</li></ul><p>If a test is marked with the <code>org.scalatest.Ignore</code> tag, implementations

which take either nothing or a single <code>Informer</code> as parameters. For each discovered test method, it assigns a test name
comprised of just the method name if the method takes no parameters, or the method name plus <code>(Informer)</code> if the

Although this trait's implementation of this method returns a <code>Set</code> whose iterator produces <code>String</code>
test names in a well-defined order, the contract of this method does not required a defined order. Subclasses are free to
override this method and return test names in an undefined order, or in a defined order that's different from <code>String</code>'s
natural order.</p><p>Subclasses may override this method to produce test names in a custom manner. One potential reason to override <code>testNames</code> is
to run tests in a different order, for example, to ensure that tests that depend on other tests are run after those other tests.
Another potential reason to override is allow tests to be defined in a different manner, such as methods annotated <code>@Test</code> annotations
(as is done in <code>JUnitSuite</code> and <code>TestNGSuite</code>) or test functions registered during construction (as is
done in <code>FunSuite</code> and <code>Spec</code>).</p></div><dl class="attributes block"> <dt>Definition Classes</dt><dd><a name="org.scalatest.Suite" class="extype" href="">Suite</a> → <a name="org.scalatest.AbstractSuite" class="extype" href="AbstractSuite.html">AbstractSuite</a></dd></dl></div>
