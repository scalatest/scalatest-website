<strong>Recommended Usage</strong>:
<code>AsyncFeatureSpec</code> is intended to enable users of <a href="FeatureSpec.html"><code>FeatureSpec</code></a>
to write non-blocking asynchronous tests that are consistent with their traditional <code>FeatureSpec</code> tests.
<em>Note: <code>AsyncFeatureSpec</code> is intended for use in special situations where non-blocking asynchronous
testing is needed, with class <code>FeatureSpec</code> used for general needs.</em>
</td></tr></table></p><p>Given a <code>Future</code> returned by the code you are testing,
you need not block until the <code>Future</code> completes before
performing assertions against its value. You can instead map those
assertions onto the <code>Future</code> and return the resulting
<code>Future[Assertion]</code> to ScalaTest. The test will complete
asynchronously, when the <code>Future[Assertion]</code> completes.</p><p>Although not required, <code>FeatureSpec</code> is often used together with <a href="GivenWhenThen.html"><code>GivenWhenThen</code></a> to express acceptance requirements
in more detail.

for trait <a href="GivenWhenThen.html"><code>GivenWhenThen</code></a> and the <a href="#informers"><code>Informers</code> section</a> below.</p><p>An <code>AsyncFeatureSpec</code> contains <em>feature clauses</em> and <em>scenarios</em>. You define a feature clause
with <code>feature</code>, and a scenario with <code>scenario</code>. Both
<code>feature</code> and <code>scenario</code> are methods, defined in
<code>AsyncFeatureSpec</code>, which will be invoked
by the primary constructor of <code>TVSetActorSpec</code>.
A feature clause describes a feature of the <em>subject</em> (class or other entity) you are specifying
and testing. In the previous example,
the subject under specification and test is a TV set. The feature being specified and tested is
the behavior of a TV set when its power button is pressed. With each scenario you provide a
string (the <em>spec text</em>) that specifies the behavior of the subject for
one scenario in which the feature may be used, and a block of code that tests that behavior.
You place the spec text between the parentheses, followed by the test code between curly
braces.  The test code will be wrapped up as a function passed as a by-name parameter to
<code>scenario</code>, which will register the test for later execution.
The result type of the by-name in an <code>AsyncFeatureSpec</code> must
be <code>Future[Assertion]</code>.</p><p>Starting with version 3.0.0, ScalaTest assertions and matchers have result type <code>Assertion</code>.
The result type of the first test in the example above, therefore, is <code>Future[Assertion]</code>.
When an <code>AsyncFeatureSpec</code> is constructed, any test that results in <code>Assertion</code> will
be implicitly converted to <code>Future[Assertion]</code> and registered. The implicit conversion is from <code>Assertion</code>
to <code>Future[Assertion]</code> only, so you must end synchronous tests in some ScalaTest assertion
or matcher expression. If a test would not otherwise end in type <code>Assertion</code>, you can
place <code>succeed</code> at the end of the test. <code>succeed</code>, a field in trait <code>Assertions</code>,
returns the <code>Succeeded</code> singleton:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; succeed
res2: org.scalatest.Assertion = Succeeded
</pre></p><p>Thus placing <code>succeed</code> at the end of a test body will satisfy the type checker.</p><p>An <code>AsyncFeatureSpec</code>'s lifecycle has two phases: the <em>registration</em> phase and the
<em>ready</em> phase. It starts in registration phase and enters ready phase the first time
<code>run</code> is called on it. It then remains in ready phase for the remainder of its lifetime.</p><p>Scenarios can only be registered with the <code>scenario</code> method while the <code>AsyncFeatureSpec</code> is
in its registration phase. Any attempt to register a scenario after the <code>AsyncFeatureSpec</code> has
entered its ready phase, <em>i.e.</em>, after <code>run</code> has been invoked on the <code>AsyncFeatureSpec</code>,
will be met with a thrown <a href="exceptions/TestRegistrationClosedException.html"><code>TestRegistrationClosedException</code></a>. The
recommended style
of using <code>AsyncFeatureSpec</code> is to register tests during object construction as is done in all
the examples shown here. If you keep to the recommended style, you should never see a
<code>TestRegistrationClosedException</code>.</p><p>Each scenario represents one test. The name of the test is the spec text passed to the <code>scenario</code> method.
The feature name does not appear as part of the test name. In a <code>AsyncFeatureSpec</code>, therefore, you must take care
to ensure that each test has a unique name (in other words, that each <code>scenario</code> has unique spec text).</p><p>When you run a <code>AsyncFeatureSpec</code>, it will send <a href="events/Formatter.html"><code>Formatter</code></a>s in the events it sends to the
<a href="Reporter.html"><code>Reporter</code></a>. ScalaTest's built-in reporters will report these events in such a way
that the output is easy to read as an informal specification of the <em>subject</em> being tested.
For example, were you to run <code>TVSetSpec</code> from within the Scala interpreter:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; org.scalatest.run(new TVSetActorSpec)
</pre></p><p>You would see:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
<span class="stGreen">TVSetActorSpec:
As a TV set owner
I want to be able to turn the TV on and off
So I can watch TV when I want
And save energy when I'm not watching TV
Feature: TV power button
  Scenario: User presses power button when TV is off
    Given a TV set that is switched off
    When the power button is pressed
    Then the TV should switch on
  Scenario: User presses power button when TV is on
    Given a TV set that is switched on
    When the power button is pressed
    Then the TV should switch off</span>
</pre></p><p>Or, to run just the &ldquo;<code>Feature: TV power button Scenario: User presses power button when TV is on</code>&rdquo; method, you could pass that test's name, or any unique substring of the
name, such as <code>"TV is on"</code>. Here's an example:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; org.scalatest.run(new TVSetActorSpec, "TV is on")
<span class="stGreen">TVSetActorSpec:

    When the power button is pressed
    Then the TV should switch off</span>
</pre></p><p><a name="asyncExecutionModel"></a></p><h4> Asynchronous execution model </h4><p><code>AsyncFeatureSpec</code> extends <a href="AsyncTestSuite.html"><code>AsyncTestSuite</code></a>, which provides an
implicit <code>scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext</code>
named <code>executionContext</code>. This
execution context is used by <code>AsyncFeatureSpec</code> to
transform the <code>Future[Assertion]</code>s returned by each test
into the <a href="FutureOutcome.html"><code>FutureOutcome</code></a> returned by the <code>test</code> function
passed to <code>withFixture</code>.
This <code>ExecutionContext</code> is also intended to be used in the tests,
including when you map assertions onto futures.</p><p>On both the JVM and Scala.js, the default execution context provided by ScalaTest's asynchronous
testing styles confines execution to a single thread per test. On JavaScript, where single-threaded
execution is the only possibility, the default execution context is
<code>scala.scalajs.concurrent.JSExecutionContext.Implicits.queue</code>. On the JVM,
the default execution context is a <em>serial execution context</em> provided by ScalaTest itself.</p><p>When ScalaTest's serial execution context is called upon to execute a task, that task is recorded
in a queue for later execution. For example, one task that will be placed in this queue is the
task that transforms the <code>Future[Assertion]</code> returned by an asynchronous test body
to the <code>FutureOutcome</code> returned from the <code>test</code> function.
Other tasks that will be queued are any transformations of, or callbacks registered on, <code>Future</code>s that occur
in your test body, including any assertions you map onto <code>Future</code>s. Once the test body returns,
the thread that executed the test body will execute the tasks in that queue one after another, in the order they
were enqueued.</p><p>ScalaTest provides its serial execution context as the default on the JVM for three reasons. First, most often
running both tests and suites in parallel does not give a significant performance boost compared to
just running suites in parallel. Thus parallel execution of <code>Future</code> transformations within
individual tests is not generally needed for performance reasons.</p><p>Second, if multiple threads are operating in the same suite
concurrently, you'll need to make sure access to any mutable fixture objects by multiple threads is synchronized.
Although access to mutable state along
the same linear chain of <code>Future</code> transformations need not be synchronized,
this does not hold true for callbacks, and in general it is easy to make a mistake. Simply put: synchronizing access to
shared mutable state is difficult and error prone.
Because ScalaTest's default execution context on the JVM confines execution of <code>Future</code> transformations
and call backs to a single thread, you need not (by default) worry about synchronizing access to mutable state
in your asynchronous-style tests.</p><p>Third, asynchronous-style tests need not be complete when the test body returns, because the test body returns
a <code>Future[Assertion]</code>. This <code>Future[Assertion]</code> will often represent a test that has not yet
completed. As a result, when using a more traditional execution context backed by a thread-pool, you could
potentially start many more tests executing concurrently than there are threads in the thread pool. The more
concurrently execute tests you have competing for threads from the same limited thread pool, the more likely it
will be that tests will intermitently fail due to timeouts.</p><p>Using ScalaTest's serial execution context on the JVM will ensure the same thread that produced the <code>Future[Assertion]</code>
returned from a test body is also used to execute any tasks given to the execution context while executing the test
body&#8212;<em>and that thread will not be allowed to do anything else until the test completes.</em>
If the serial execution context's task queue ever becomes empty while the <code>Future[Assertion]</code> returned by
that test's body has not yet completed, the thread will <em>block</em> until another task for that test is enqueued. Although
it may seem counter-intuitive, this blocking behavior means the total number of tests allowed to run concurrently will be limited
to the total number of threads executing suites. This fact means you can tune the thread pool such that maximum performance
is reached while avoiding (or at least, reducing the likelihood of) tests that fail due to timeouts because of thread competition.</p><p>This thread confinement strategy does mean, however, that when you are using the default execution context on the JVM, you
must be sure to <em>never block</em> in the test body waiting for a task to be completed by the
execution context. If you block, your test will never complete. This kind of problem will be obvious, because the test will
consistently hang every time you run it. (If a test is hanging, and you're not sure which one it is,
enable <a href="Runner.scala#slowpokeNotifications">slowpoke notifications</a>.) If you really do
want to block in your tests, you may wish to just use a
traditional <a href="FeatureSpec.html"><code>FeatureSpec</code></a> with
<a href="concurrent/ScalaFutures.html"><code>ScalaFutures</code></a> instead. Alternatively, you could override
the <code>executionContext</code> and use a traditional <code>ExecutionContext</code> backed by a thread pool. This
will enable you to block in an asynchronous-style test on the JVM, but you'll need to worry about synchronizing access to
shared mutable state.</p><p>To use a different execution context, just override <code>executionContext</code>. For example, if you prefer to use
the <code>runNow</code> execution context on Scala.js instead of the default <code>queue</code>, you would write:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stLineComment">// on Scala.js</span>
<span class="stReserved">implicit</span> <span class="stReserved">override</span> <span class="stReserved">def</span> executionContext =
    scala.scalajs.concurrent.JSExecutionContext.Implicits.runNow
</pre></p><p>If you prefer on the JVM to use the global execution context, which is backed by a thread pool, instead of ScalaTest's default
serial execution contex, which confines execution to a single thread, you would write:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stLineComment">// on the JVM (and also compiles on Scala.js, giving</span>
<span class="stLineComment">// you the queue execution context)</span>
<span class="stReserved">implicit</span> <span class="stReserved">override</span> <span class="stReserved">def</span> executionContext =
    scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global
</pre></p><p><a name="serialAndParallel"></a></p><h4> Serial and parallel test execution </h4><p>By default (unless you mix in <code>ParallelTestExecution</code>), tests in an <code>AsyncFeatureSpec</code> will be executed one after
another, <em>i.e.</em>, serially. This is true whether those tests return <code>Assertion</code> or <code>Future[Assertion]</code>,
no matter what threads are involved. This default behavior allows
you to re-use a shared fixture, such as an external database that needs to be cleaned
after each test, in multiple tests in async-style suites. This is implemented by registering each test, other than the first test, to run
as a <em>continuation</em> after the previous test completes.</p><p>If you want the tests of an <code>AsyncFeatureSpec</code> to be executed in parallel, you
must mix in <code>ParallelTestExecution</code> and enable parallel execution of tests in your build.
You enable parallel execution in <a href="tools/Runner$.html"><code>Runner</code></a> with the <code>-P</code> command line flag.
In the ScalaTest Maven Plugin, set <code>parallel</code> to <code>true</code>.
In <code>sbt</code>, parallel execution is the default, but to be explicit you can write:</p><p><pre>
parallelExecution in Test := true // the default in sbt
</pre></p><p>On the JVM, if both <a href="ParallelTestExecution.html"><code>ParallelTestExecution</code></a> is mixed in and
parallel execution is enabled in the build, tests in an async-style suite will be started in parallel, using threads from
the <a href="Distributor"><code>Distributor</code></a>, and allowed to complete in parallel, using threads from the
<code>executionContext</code>. If you are using ScalaTest's serial execution context, the JVM default, asynchronous tests will
run in parallel very much like traditional (such as <a href="FeatureSpec.html"><code>FeatureSpec</code></a>) tests run in
parallel: 1) Because <code>ParallelTestExecution</code> extends
<code>OneInstancePerTest</code>, each test will run in its own instance of the test class, you need not worry about synchronizing
access to mutable instance state shared by different tests in the same suite.
2) Because the serial execution context will confine the execution of each test to the single thread that executes the test body,
you need not worry about synchronizing access to shared mutable state accessed by transformations and callbacks of <code>Future</code>s
inside the test.</p><p>If <a href="ParallelTestExecution.html"><code>ParallelTestExecution</code></a> is mixed in but
parallel execution of suites is <em>not</em> enabled, asynchronous tests on the JVM will be started sequentially, by the single thread
that invoked <code>run</code>, but without waiting for one test to complete before the next test is started. As a result,
asynchronous tests will be allowed to <em>complete</em> in parallel, using threads
from the <code>executionContext</code>. If you are using the serial execution context, however, you'll see
the same behavior you see when parallel execution is disabled and a traditional suite that mixes in <code>ParallelTestExecution</code>
is executed: the tests will run sequentially. If you use an execution context backed by a thread-pool, such as <code>global</code>,
however, even though tests will be started sequentially by one thread, they will be allowed to run concurrently using threads from the
execution context's thread pool.</p><p>The latter behavior is essentially what you'll see on Scala.js when you execute a suite that mixes in <code>ParallelTestExecution</code>.
Because only one thread exists when running under JavaScript, you can't &quot;enable parallel execution of suites.&quot; However, it may
still be useful to run tests in parallel on Scala.js, because tests can invoke API calls that are truly asynchronous by calling into
external APIs that take advantage of non-JavaScript threads. Thus on Scala.js, <code>ParallelTestExecution</code> allows asynchronous
tests to run in parallel, even though they must be started sequentially. This may give you better performance when you are using API
calls in your Scala.js tests that are truly asynchronous.</p><p><a name="futuresAndExpectedExceptions"></a></p><h4> Futures and expected exceptions </h4><p>If you need to test for expected exceptions in the context of futures, you can use the
<code>recoverToSucceededIf</code> and <code>recoverToExceptionIf</code> methods of trait
<a href="RecoverMethods.html"><code>RecoverMethods</code></a>. Because this trait is mixed into
supertrait <code>AsyncTestSuite</code>, both of these methods are
available by default in an <code>AsyncFeatureSpec</code>.</p><p>If you just want to ensure that a future fails with a particular exception type, and do
not need to inspect the exception further, use <code>recoverToSucceededIf</code>:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
recoverToSucceededIf[<span class="stType">IllegalStateException</span>] { <span class="stLineComment">// Result type: Future[Assertion]</span>
  emptyStackActor ? <span class="stType">Peek</span>
}
</pre></p><p>The <code>recoverToSucceededIf</code> method performs a job similar to
<a href="Assertions.html#assertThrowsMethod"><code>assertThrows</code></a>, except
in the context of a future. It transforms a <code>Future</code> of any type into a
<code>Future[Assertion]</code> that succeeds only if the original future fails with the specified
exception. Here's an example in the REPL:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; import org.scalatest.RecoverMethods._

scala&gt; import scala.concurrent.Future
import scala.concurrent.Future

scala&gt; import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global

scala&gt; recoverToSucceededIf[IllegalStateException] {
     |   Future { throw new IllegalStateException }
     | }
res0: scala.concurrent.Future[org.scalatest.Assertion] = ...

scala&gt; res0.value
res1: Option[scala.util.Try[org.scalatest.Assertion]] = Some(Success(Succeeded))
</pre></p><p>Otherwise it fails with an error message similar to those given by <code>assertThrows</code>:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; recoverToSucceededIf[IllegalStateException] {
     |   Future { throw new RuntimeException }
     | }
res2: scala.concurrent.Future[org.scalatest.Assertion] = ...

scala&gt; res2.value
res3: Option[scala.util.Try[org.scalatest.Assertion]] =
    Some(Failure(org.scalatest.exceptions.TestFailedException: Expected exception
      java.lang.IllegalStateException to be thrown, but java.lang.RuntimeException
      was thrown))

scala&gt; recoverToSucceededIf[IllegalStateException] {
     |   Future { 42 }
     | }
res4: scala.concurrent.Future[org.scalatest.Assertion] = ...

scala&gt; res4.value
res5: Option[scala.util.Try[org.scalatest.Assertion]] =
    Some(Failure(org.scalatest.exceptions.TestFailedException: Expected exception
      java.lang.IllegalStateException to be thrown, but no exception was thrown))
</pre></p><p>The <code>recoverToExceptionIf</code> method differs from the <code>recoverToSucceededIf</code> in
its behavior when the assertion succeeds: <code>recoverToSucceededIf</code> yields a <code>Future[Assertion]</code>,
whereas <code>recoverToExceptionIf</code> yields a <code>Future[T]</code>, where <code>T</code> is the
expected exception type.</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
recoverToExceptionIf[<span class="stType">IllegalStateException</span>] { <span class="stLineComment">// Result type: Future[IllegalStateException]</span>
  emptyStackActor ? <span class="stType">Peek</span>
}
</pre></p><p>In other words, <code>recoverToExpectionIf</code> is to
<a href="Assertions.html#interceptMethod"><code>intercept</code></a> as
<code>recovertToSucceededIf</code> is to <a href="Assertions.html#assertThrowsMethod"><code>assertThrows</code></a>. The first one allows you to
perform further assertions on the expected exception. The second one gives you a result type that will satisfy the type checker
at the end of the test body. Here's an example showing <code>recoverToExceptionIf</code> in the REPL:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">

good intention of resurrecting the test at a later time, <code>AsyncFeatureSpec</code> provides registration

  }
}
</pre></p><p>When you mark a test class with a tag annotation, ScalaTest will mark each test defined in that class with that tag.
Thus, marking the <code>AddSpec</code> in the above example with the <code>@Ignore</code> tag annotation means that both tests
in the class will be ignored. If you run the above <code>AddSpec</code> in the Scala interpreter, you'll see:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
<span class="stGreen">AddSpec:</span>
<span class="stGreen">Feature: The add methods</span>
<span class="stYellow">- Scenario: addSoon will eventually compute a sum of passed Ints !!! IGNORED !!!</span>
<span class="stYellow">- Scenario: addNow will immediately compute a sum of passed Ints !!! IGNORED !!!</span>
</pre></p><p>Note that marking a test class as ignored won't prevent it from being discovered by ScalaTest. Ignored classes
will be discovered and run, and all their tests will be reported as ignored. This is intended to keep the ignored
class visible, to encourage the developers to eventually fix and &ldquo;un-ignore&rdquo; it. If you want to
prevent a class from being discovered at all (on the JVM, not Scala.js), use the <a href="DoNotDiscover.html"><code>DoNotDiscover</code></a>
annotation instead.</p><p>If you want to ignore all tests of a suite on Scala.js, where annotations can't be inspected at runtime, you'll need
to change <code>it</code> to <code>ignore</code> at each test site. To make a suite non-discoverable on Scala.js, ensure it
does not declare a public no-arg constructor.  You can either declare a public constructor that takes one or more
arguments, or make the no-arg constructor non-public.  Because this technique will also make the suite non-discoverable
on the JVM, it is a good approach for suites you want to run (but not be discoverable) on both Scala.js and the JVM.</p><p><a name="informers"></a></p><h4> Informers </h4><p>One of the parameters to <code>AsyncFeatureSpec</code>'s <code>run</code> method is a <code>Reporter</code>, which
will collect and report information about the running suite of tests.
Information about suites and tests that were run, whether tests succeeded or failed,
and tests that were ignored will be passed to the <a href="Reporter.html"><code>Reporter</code></a> as the suite runs.
Most often the default reporting done by <code>AsyncFeatureSpec</code>'s methods will be sufficient, but
occasionally you may wish to provide custom information to the <code>Reporter</code> from a test.
For this purpose, an <a href="Informer.html"><code>Informer</code></a> that will forward information to the current <code>Reporter</code>
is provided via the <code>info</code> parameterless method.
You can pass the extra information to the <code>Informer</code> via its <code>apply</code> method.
The <code>Informer</code> will then pass the information to the <code>Reporter</code> via an <a href="events/InfoProvided.html"><code>InfoProvided</code></a> event.</p><p>One use case for the <code>Informer</code> is to pass more information about a scenario to the reporter. For example,
the <code>GivenWhenThen</code> trait provides methods that use the implicit <code>info</code> provided by <code>AsyncFeatureSpec</code>
to pass such information to the reporter. You can see this in action in the <a href="#initialExample">initial example</a> of this trait's documentation.</p><p><a name="documenters"></a></p><h4> Documenters </h4><p><code>AsyncFeatureSpec</code> also provides a <code>markup</code> method that returns a <a href="Documenter.html"><code>Documenter</code></a>, which allows you to send
to the <code>Reporter</code> text formatted in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" target="_blank">Markdown syntax</a>.
You can pass the extra information to the <code>Documenter</code> via its <code>apply</code> method.
The <code>Documenter</code> will then pass the information to the <code>Reporter</code> via an <a href="events/MarkupProvided.html"><code>MarkupProvided</code></a> event.</p><p>Here's an example <code>FlatSpec</code> that uses <code>markup</code>:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">

</pre></p><p>Although all of ScalaTest's built-in reporters will display the markup text in some form,
the HTML reporter will format the markup information into HTML. Thus, the main purpose of <code>markup</code> is to
add nicely formatted text to HTML reports. Here's what the above <code>SetSpec</code> would look like in the HTML reporter:</p><p><img class="stScreenShot" src="../../lib/featureSpec.gif"></p><p><a name="notifiersAlerters"></a></p><h4> Notifiers and alerters </h4><p>ScalaTest records text passed to <code>info</code> and <code>markup</code> during tests, and sends the recorded text in the <code>recordedEvents</code> field of
test completion events like <code>TestSucceeded</code> and <code>TestFailed</code>. This allows string reporters (like the standard out reporter) to show
<code>info</code> and <code>markup</code> text <em>after</em> the test name in a color determined by the outcome of the test. For example, if the test fails, string
reporters will show the <code>info</code> and <code>markup</code> text in red. If a test succeeds, string reporters will show the <code>info</code>
and <code>markup</code> text in green. While this approach helps the readability of reports, it means that you can't use <code>info</code> to get status
updates from long running tests.</p><p>To get immediate (<em>i.e.</em>, non-recorded) notifications from tests, you can use <code>note</code> (a <a href="Notifier.html"><code>Notifier</code></a>) and <code>alert</code>
(an <a href="Alerter.html"><code>Alerter</code></a>). Here's an example showing the differences:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">package</span> org.scalatest.examples.asyncfeaturespec.note

<span class="stReserved">import</span> collection.mutable
<span class="stReserved">import</span> org.scalatest._

<span class="stReserved">class</span> <span class="stType">SetSpec</span> <span class="stReserved">extends</span> <span class="stType">AsyncFeatureSpec</span> {

      markup(<span class="stQuotedString">"markup is *also* recorded"</span>)

      alert(<span class="stQuotedString">"alerts are also sent immediately"</span>)

      <span class="stReserved">val</span> set = mutable.Set.empty[<span class="stType">String</span>]
      set += <span class="stQuotedString">"clarity"</span>
      assert(set.size === <span class="stLiteral">1</span>)
      assert(set.contains(<span class="stQuotedString">"clarity"</span>))
    }
  }
}
</pre></p><p>Because <code>note</code> and <code>alert</code> information is sent immediately, it will appear <em>before</em> the test name in string reporters, and its color will
be unrelated to the ultimate outcome of the test: <code>note</code> text will always appear in green, <code>alert</code> text will always appear in yellow.
Here's an example:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; org.scalatest.run(new SetSpec)
<span class="stGreen">SetSpec:
Feature: An element can be added to an empty mutable Set
  + notes are sent immediately</span>
  <span class="stYellow">+ alerts are also sent immediately</span>
  <span class="stGreen">Scenario: When an element is added to an empty mutable Set
    info is recorded
  + markup is *also* recorded</span>
</pre></p><p>Another example is <a href="tools/Runner$.html#slowpokeNotifications">slowpoke notifications</a>.
If you find a test is taking a long time to complete, but you're not sure which test, you can enable
slowpoke notifications. ScalaTest will use an <code>Alerter</code> to fire an event whenever a test has been running
longer than a specified amount of time.</p><p>In summary, use <code>info</code> and <code>markup</code> for text that should form part of the specification output. Use
<code>note</code> and <code>alert</code> to send status notifications. (Because the HTML reporter is intended to produce a
readable, printable specification, <code>info</code> and <code>markup</code> text will appear in the HTML report, but
<code>note</code> and <code>alert</code> text will not.)</p><p><a name="pendingTests"></a></p><h4> Pending tests </h4><p>A <em>pending test</em> is one that has been given a name but is not yet implemented. The purpose of
pending tests is to facilitate a style of testing in which documentation of behavior is sketched
out before tests are written to verify that behavior (and often, before the behavior of
the system being tested is itself implemented). Such sketches form a kind of specification of
what tests and functionality to implement later.</p><p>To support this style of testing, a test can be given a name that specifies one
bit of behavior required by the system being tested. At the end of the test,
it can call method <code>pending</code>, which will cause it to complete abruptly with <code>TestPendingException</code>.</p><p>Because tests in ScalaTest can be designated as pending with <code>TestPendingException</code>, both the test name and any information
sent to the reporter when running the test can appear in the report of a test run. (In other words,
the code of a pending test is executed just like any other test.) However, because the test completes abruptly
with <code>TestPendingException</code>, the test will be reported as pending, to indicate
the actual test, and possibly the functionality, has not yet been implemented. Here's an example:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">package</span> org.scalatest.examples.asyncfeaturespec.pending

<span class="stReserved">import</span> org.scalatest.AsyncFeatureSpec
<span class="stReserved">import</span> scala.concurrent.Future

  <span class="stReserved">def</span> addSoon(addends: <span class="stType">Int</span>*): <span class="stType">Future[Int]</span> = <span class="stType">Future</span> { addends.sum }
  <span class="stReserved">def</span> addNow(addends: <span class="stType">Int</span>*): <span class="stType">Int</span> = addends.sum

  feature(<span class="stQuotedString">"The add methods"</span>) {

    scenario(<span class="stQuotedString">"addSoon will eventually compute a sum of passed Ints"</span>) (pending)

    scenario(<span class="stQuotedString">"addNow will immediately compute a sum of passed Ints"</span>) {
      <span class="stReserved">val</span> sum: <span class="stType">Int</span> = addNow(<span class="stLiteral">1</span>, <span class="stLiteral">2</span>)
      <span class="stLineComment">// You can also write synchronous tests. The body</span>
      <span class="stLineComment">// must have result type Assertion:</span>
      assert(sum == <span class="stLiteral">3</span>)
    }
  }
}
</pre></p><p>(Note: &quot;<code>(pending)</code>&quot; is the body of the test. Thus the test contains just one statement, an invocation
of the <code>pending</code> method, which throws <code>TestPendingException</code>.)
If you run this version of <code>AddSpec</code> with:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; org.scalatest.run(new AddSpec)
</pre></p><p>It will run both tests, but report that first test is pending. You'll see:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
<span class="stGreen">AddSpec:</span>
<span class="stGreen">Feature: The add methods</span>
<span class="stYellow">- Scenario: addSoon will eventually compute a sum of passed Ints (pending)</span>
<span class="stGreen">- Scenario: addNow will immediately compute a sum of passed Ints</span>
</pre></p><p>One difference between an ignored test and a pending one is that an ignored test is intended to be used during
significant refactorings of the code under test, when tests break and you don't want to spend the time to fix
all of them immediately. You can mark some of those broken tests as ignored temporarily, so that you can focus the red
bar on just failing tests you actually want to fix immediately. Later you can go back and fix the ignored tests.
In other words, by ignoring some failing tests temporarily, you can more easily notice failed tests that you actually
want to fix. By contrast, a pending test is intended to be used before a test and/or the code under test is written.
Pending indicates you've decided to write a test for a bit of behavior, but either you haven't written the test yet, or
have only written part of it, or perhaps you've written the test but don't want to implement the behavior it tests
until after you've implemented a different bit of behavior you realized you need first. Thus ignored tests are designed
to facilitate refactoring of existing code whereas pending tests are designed to facilitate the creation of new code.</p><p>One other difference between ignored and pending tests is that ignored tests are implemented as a test tag that is
excluded by default. Thus an ignored test is never executed. By contrast, a pending test is implemented as a
test that throws <code>TestPendingException</code> (which is what calling the <code>pending</code> method does). Thus
the body of pending tests are executed up until they throw <code>TestPendingException</code>.</p><p><a name="taggingTests"></a></p><h4> Tagging tests </h4><p>An <code>AsyncFeatureSpec</code>'s tests may be classified into groups by <em>tagging</em> them with string names.
As with any suite, when executing an <code>AsyncFeatureSpec</code>, groups of tests can
optionally be included and/or excluded. To tag an <code>AsyncFeatureSpec</code>'s tests,
you pass objects that extend class <code>org.scalatest.Tag</code> to methods
that register tests. Class <code>Tag</code> takes one parameter, a string name.  If you have
created tag annotation interfaces as described in the <a href="Tag.html"><code>Tag</code> documentation</a>, then you
will probably want to use tag names on your test functions that match. To do so, simply
pass the fully qualified names of the tag interfaces to the <code>Tag</code> constructor. For example, if you've
defined a tag annotation interface with fully qualified name,
<code>com.mycompany.tags.DbTest</code>, then you could
create a matching tag for <code>AsyncFeatureSpec</code>s like this:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">package</span> org.scalatest.examples.asyncfeaturespec.tagging

  }
}
</pre></p><p>This code marks both tests with the <code>org.scalatest.tags.Slow</code> tag,
and the second test with the <code>com.mycompany.tags.DbTest</code> tag.</p><p>The <code>run</code> method takes a <code>Filter</code>, whose constructor takes an optional
<code>Set[String]</code> called <code>tagsToInclude</code> and a <code>Set[String]</code> called
<code>tagsToExclude</code>. If <code>tagsToInclude</code> is <code>None</code>, all tests will be run
except those those belonging to tags listed in the
<code>tagsToExclude</code> <code>Set</code>. If <code>tagsToInclude</code> is defined, only tests
belonging to tags mentioned in the <code>tagsToInclude</code> set, and not mentioned in <code>tagsToExclude</code>,
will be run.</p><p>It is recommended, though not required, that you create a corresponding tag annotation when you
create a <code>Tag</code> object. A tag annotation (on the JVM, not Scala.js) allows you to tag all the tests of an <code>AsyncFeatureSpec</code> in
one stroke by annotating the class. For more information and examples, see the
<a href="Tag.html">documentation for class <code>Tag</code></a>. On Scala.js, to tag all tests of a suite, you'll need to
tag each test individually at the test site.</p><p><a name="sharedFixtures"></a></p><h4> Shared fixtures </h4><p>A test <em>fixture</em> is composed of the objects and other artifacts (files, sockets, database
connections, <em>etc.</em>) tests use to do their work.
When multiple tests need to work with the same fixtures, it is important to try and avoid
duplicating the fixture code across those tests. The more code duplication you have in your
tests, the greater drag the tests will have on refactoring the actual production code.</p><p>ScalaTest recommends three techniques to eliminate such code duplication in async styles:</p><ul><li>Refactor using Scala</li><li>Override <code>withFixture</code></li><li>Mix in a <em>before-and-after</em> trait</li></ul><p>Each technique is geared towards helping you reduce code duplication without introducing
instance <code>var</code>s, shared mutable objects, or other dependencies between tests. Eliminating shared
mutable state across tests will make your test code easier to reason about and eliminate the need to
synchronize access to shared mutable state on the JVM.</p><p>The following sections describe these techniques, including explaining the recommended usage
for each. But first, here's a table summarizing the options:</p><p><table style="border-collapse: collapse; border: 1px solid black">

more <em>get-fixture</em> methods. A get-fixture method returns a new instance of a needed fixture object (or a holder object containing
multiple fixture objects) each time it is called. You can call a get-fixture method at the beginning of each
test that needs the fixture, storing the returned object or objects in local variables. Here's an example:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">

      }
    }
  }
}
</pre></p><p>If you need to configure fixture objects differently in different tests, you can pass configuration into the get-fixture method.
For example, you could pass in an initial value for a fixture object as a parameter to the get-fixture method.</p><p><a name="withFixtureNoArgAsyncTest"></a></p><h6> Overriding <code>withFixture(NoArgAsyncTest)</code> </h6><p>Although the get-fixture method approach takes care of setting up a fixture at the beginning of each
test, it doesn't address the problem of cleaning up a fixture at the end of the test. If you just need to perform a side-effect at the beginning or end of
a test, and don't need to actually pass any fixture objects into the test, you can override <code>withFixture(NoArgAsyncTest)</code>, a
method defined in trait <a href="AsyncTestSuite.html"><code>AsyncTestSuite</code></a>, a supertrait of <code>AsyncFeatureSpec</code>.</p><p>Trait <code>AsyncFeatureSpec</code>'s <code>runTest</code> method passes a no-arg async test function to
<code>withFixture(NoArgAsyncTest)</code>. It is <code>withFixture</code>'s
responsibility to invoke that test function. The default implementation of <code>withFixture</code> simply
invokes the function and returns the result, like this:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stLineComment">// Default implementation in trait AsyncTestSuite</span>
<span class="stReserved">protected</span> <span class="stReserved">def</span> withFixture(test: <span class="stType">NoArgAsyncTest</span>): <span class="stType">FutureOutcome</span> = {
  test()
}
</pre></p><p>You can, therefore, override <code>withFixture</code> to perform setup before invoking the test function,
and/or perform cleanup after the test completes. The recommended way to ensure cleanup is performed after a test completes is
to use the <code>complete</code>-<code>lastly</code> syntax, defined in supertrait <a href="CompleteLastly.html"><code>CompleteLastly</code></a>.
The <code>complete</code>-<code>lastly</code> syntax will ensure that
cleanup will occur whether future-producing code completes abruptly by throwing an exception, or returns
normally yielding a future. In the latter case, <code>complete</code>-<code>lastly</code> will register the cleanup code
to execute asynchronously when the future completes.</p><p>The <code>withFixture</code> method is designed to be stacked, and to enable this, you should always call the <code>super</code> implementation
of <code>withFixture</code>, and let it invoke the test function rather than invoking the test function directly. In other words, instead of writing
&ldquo;<code>test()</code>&rdquo;, you should write &ldquo;<code>super.withFixture(test)</code>&rdquo;, like this:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">

</pre></p><p>If you want to perform an action only for certain outcomes, you'll need to
register code performing that action as a callback on the <code>Future</code> using
one of <code>Future</code>'s registration methods: <code>onComplete</code>, <code>onSuccess</code>,
or <code>onFailure</code>. Note that if a test fails, that will be treated as a
<code>scala.util.Success(org.scalatest.Failed)</code>. So if you want to perform an
action if a test fails, for example, you'd register the callback using <code>onSuccess</code>.</p><p>Here's an example in which <code>withFixture(NoArgAsyncTest)</code> is used to take a

</pre></p><p>Note that a <code>NoArgAsyncTest</code>'s <code>apply</code> method will return a <code>scala.util.Failure</code> only if
the test completes abruptly with a &quot;test-fatal&quot; exception (such as <code>OutOfMemoryError</code>) that should
cause the suite to abort rather than the test to fail. Thus usually you would use <code>map</code>
to transform future outcomes, not <code>transform</code>, so that such test-fatal exceptions pass through
unchanged. The suite will abort asynchronously with any exception returned from <code>NoArgAsyncTest</code>'s
apply method in a <code>scala.util.Failure</code>.</p><p><a name="loanFixtureMethods"></a></p><h6> Calling loan-fixture methods </h6><p>If you need to both pass a fixture object into a test <em>and</em> perform cleanup at the end of the test, you'll need to use the <em>loan pattern</em>.
If different tests need different fixtures that require cleanup, you can implement the loan pattern directly by writing <em>loan-fixture</em> methods.
A loan-fixture method takes a function whose body forms part or all of a test's code. It creates a fixture, passes it to the test code by invoking the
function, then cleans up the fixture after the function returns.</p><p>The following example shows three tests that use two fixtures, a database and a file. Both require cleanup after, so each is provided via a

give each test the fixture it needs, they allow you to give a test multiple fixtures and clean everything up afterwards.</p><p>Also demonstrated in this example is the technique of giving each test its own &quot;fixture sandbox&quot; to play in. When your fixtures
involve external side-effects, like creating databases, it is a good idea to give each database a unique name as is
done in this example. This keeps tests completely isolated, allowing you to run them in parallel if desired.</p><p><a name="withFixtureOneArgAsyncTest"></a></p><h6> Overriding <code>withFixture(OneArgTest)</code> </h6><p>If all or most tests need the same fixture, you can avoid some of the boilerplate of the loan-fixture method approach by using a
<code>fixture.AsyncTestSuite</code> and overriding <code>withFixture(OneArgAsyncTest)</code>.
Each test in a <code>fixture.AsyncTestSuite</code> takes a fixture as a parameter, allowing you to pass the fixture into
the test. You must indicate the type of the fixture parameter by specifying <code>FixtureParam</code>, and implement a
<code>withFixture</code> method that takes a <code>OneArgAsyncTest</code>. This <code>withFixture</code> method is responsible for
invoking the one-arg async test function, so you can perform fixture set up before invoking and passing
the fixture into the test function, and ensure clean up is performed after the test completes.</p><p>To enable the stacking of traits that define <code>withFixture(NoArgAsyncTest)</code>, it is a good idea to let
<code>withFixture(NoArgAsyncTest)</code> invoke the test function instead of invoking the test
function directly. To do so, you'll need to convert the <code>OneArgAsyncTest</code> to a <code>NoArgAsyncTest</code>. You can do that by passing
the fixture object to the <code>toNoArgAsyncTest</code> method of <code>OneArgAsyncTest</code>. In other words, instead of
writing &ldquo;<code>test(theFixture)</code>&rdquo;, you'd delegate responsibility for
invoking the test function to the <code>withFixture(NoArgAsyncTest)</code> method of the same instance by writing:</p><p><pre>

</pre></p><p>In this example, the tests required one fixture object, a <code>StringActor</code>. If your tests need multiple fixture objects, you can
simply define the <code>FixtureParam</code> type to be a tuple containing the objects or, alternatively, a case class containing
the objects.  For more information on the <code>withFixture(OneArgAsyncTest)</code> technique, see
the <a href="fixture/AsyncFeatureSpec.html">documentation for <code>fixture.AsyncFeatureSpec</code></a>.</p><p><a name="beforeAndAfter"></a></p><h6> Mixing in <code>BeforeAndAfter</code> </h6><p>In all the shared fixture examples shown so far, the activities of creating, setting up, and cleaning up the fixture objects have been
performed <em>during</em> the test.  This means that if an exception occurs during any of these activities, it will be reported as a test failure.
Sometimes, however, you may want setup to happen <em>before</em> the test starts, and cleanup <em>after</em> the test has completed, so that if an
exception occurs during setup or cleanup, the entire suite aborts and no more tests are attempted. The simplest way to accomplish this in ScalaTest is
to mix in trait <a href="BeforeAndAfter.html"><code>BeforeAndAfter</code></a>.  With this trait you can denote a bit of code to run before each test
with <code>before</code> and/or after each test each test with <code>after</code>, like this:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">

</pre></p><p>Note that the only way <code>before</code> and <code>after</code> code can communicate with test code is via some
side-effecting mechanism, commonly by reassigning instance <code>var</code>s or by changing the state of mutable
objects held from instance <code>val</code>s (as in this example). If using instance <code>var</code>s or
mutable objects held from instance <code>val</code>s you wouldn't be able to run tests in parallel in the same instance
of the test class (on the JVM, not Scala.js) unless you synchronized access to the shared, mutable state.</p><p>Note that on the JVM, if you override ScalaTest's default
<a href="#asyncExecutionModel"><em>serial execution context</em></a>, you will likely need to
worry about synchronizing access to shared mutable fixture state, because the execution
context may assign different threads to process
different <code>Future</code> transformations. Although access to mutable state along
the same linear chain of <code>Future</code> transformations need not be synchronized,
it can be difficult to spot cases where these constraints are violated. The best approach
is to use only immutable objects when transforming <code>Future</code>s. When that's not
practical, involve only thread-safe mutable objects, as is done in the above example.
On Scala.js, by contrast, you need not worry about thread synchronization, because
in effect only one thread exists.</p><p>Although <code>BeforeAndAfter</code> provides a minimal-boilerplate way to execute code before and after tests, it isn't designed to enable stackable
traits, because the order of execution would be non-obvious.  If you want to factor out before and after code that is common to multiple test suites, you
should use trait <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> instead, as shown later in the next section,
<a href="#composingFixtures.html">composing fixtures by stacking traits</a>.</p><p><a name="composingFixtures"></a></p><h4> Composing fixtures by stacking traits </h4><p>In larger projects, teams often end up with several different fixtures that test classes need in different combinations,
and possibly initialized (and cleaned up) in different orders. A good way to accomplish this in ScalaTest is to factor the individual
fixtures into traits that can be composed using the <em>stackable trait</em> pattern. This can be done, for example, by placing
<code>withFixture</code> methods in several traits, each of which call <code>super.withFixture</code>. Here's an example in
which the <code>StringBuilderActor</code> and <code>StringBufferActor</code> fixtures used in the previous examples have been
factored out into two <em>stackable fixture traits</em> named <code>Builder</code> and <code>Buffer</code>:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">

In this case, <code>Builder</code> is &ldquo;super&rdquo; to <code>Buffer</code>. If you wanted <code>Buffer</code> to be &ldquo;super&rdquo;

</pre></p><p>To get the same ordering as <code>withFixture</code>, place your <code>super.beforeEach</code> call at the end of each
<code>beforeEach</code> method, and the <code>super.afterEach</code> call at the beginning of each <code>afterEach</code>
method, as shown in the previous example. It is a good idea to invoke <code>super.afterEach</code> in a <code>try</code>
block and perform cleanup in a <code>finally</code> clause, as shown in the previous example, because this ensures the
cleanup code is performed even if <code>super.afterEach</code> throws an exception.</p><p>The difference between stacking traits that extend <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> versus traits that implement <code>withFixture</code> is
that setup and cleanup code happens before and after the test in <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code>, but at the beginning and
end of the test in <code>withFixture</code>. Thus if a <code>withFixture</code> method completes abruptly with an exception, it is
considered a failed test. By contrast, if any of the <code>beforeEach</code> or <code>afterEach</code> methods of <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code>
complete abruptly, it is considered an aborted suite, which will result in a <a href="events/SuiteAborted.html"><code>SuiteAborted</code></a> event.</p><p><a name="sharedTests"></a></p><h4> Shared tests </h4><p>Sometimes you may want to run the same test code on different fixture objects. In other words, you may want to write tests that are &quot;shared&quot;
by different fixture objects.
To accomplish this in an <code>AsyncFeatureSpec</code>, you first place shared tests in
<em>behavior functions</em>. These behavior functions will be
invoked during the construction phase of any <code>AsyncFeatureSpec</code> that uses them, so that the tests they contain will
be registered as tests in that <code>AsyncFeatureSpec</code>.

<em>etc</em>. You may find you have several tests that make sense any time the stack is non-empty. Thus you'd ideally want to run
those same tests for three stack fixture objects: a full stack, a stack with a one item, and a stack with one item less than
capacity. With shared tests, you can factor these tests out into a behavior function, into which you pass the
stack fixture to use when running the tests. So in your <code>AsyncFeatureSpec</code> for <code>StackActor</code>, you'd invoke the
behavior function three times, passing in each of the three stack fixtures so that the shared tests are run for all three fixtures.</p><p>You can define a behavior function that encapsulates these shared tests inside the <code>AsyncFeatureSpec</code> that uses them. If they are shared
between different <code>AsyncFeatureSpec</code>s, however, you could also define them in a separate trait that is mixed into
each <code>AsyncFeatureSpec</code> that uses them.

</pre></p><p>One thing to keep in mind when using shared tests is that in ScalaTest, each test in a suite must have a unique name.
If you register the same tests repeatedly in the same suite, one problem you may encounter is an exception at runtime
complaining that multiple tests are being registered with the same test name.
Although in an <code>AsyncFeatureSpec</code>, the <code>feature</code> clause is a nesting construct analogous to
<code>AsyncFunSpec</code>'s <code>describe</code> clause, you many sometimes need to do a bit of
extra work to ensure that the test names are unique. If a duplicate test name problem shows up in an
<code>AsyncFeatureSpec</code>, you'll need to pass in a prefix or suffix string to add to each test name. You can call
<code>toString</code> on the shared fixture object, or pass this string
the same way you pass any other data needed by the shared tests.

does not return the expected exception, so it does not let you perform further assertions on
that exception. Instead, this method returns <code>Succeeded</code>, which means it can
serve as the last statement in an async- or safe-style suite. It also indicates to the reader
of the code that nothing further is expected about the thrown exception other than its type.

snippet does not pass the Scala parser.</p><p>Often when creating libraries you may wish to ensure that certain arrangements of code that
represent potential &ldquo;user errors&rdquo; do not compile, so that your library is more error resistant.
ScalaTest's <code>Assertions</code> trait includes the following syntax for that purpose:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
assertTypeError(<span class="stQuotedString">"val a: String = 1"</span>)
</pre></p><p>Although <code>assertTypeError</code> is implemented with a macro that determines at compile time whether
the snippet of code represented by the passed string type checks, errors (<em>i.e.</em>,
snippets of code that <em>do</em> type check) are reported as test failures at runtime.</p><p>Note that the difference between <code>assertTypeError</code> and <code>assertDoesNotCompile</code> is
that <code>assertDoesNotCompile</code> will succeed if the given code does not compile for any reason,
whereas <code>assertTypeError</code> will only succeed if the given code does not compile because of
a type error. If the given code does not compile because of a syntax error, for example, <code>assertDoesNotCompile</code>
will return normally but <code>assertTypeError</code> will throw a <code>TestFailedException</code>.</p></div><dl class="paramcmts block"><dt class="param">code</dt><dd class="cmt"><p>the snippet of code that should not type check</p></dd></dl><dl class="attributes block"> <dt>Definition Classes</dt><dd><a href="Assertions.html" class="extype" name="org.scalatest.Assertions">Assertions</a></dd></dl></div>

      <p class="shortcomment cmt">Executes one or more tests in this <code>Suite</code>, printing results to the standard output.</code></p><div class="fullcomment"><div class="comment cmt"><p>Executes one or more tests in this <code>Suite</code>, printing results to the standard output.</p><p>This method invokes <code>run</code> on itself, passing in values that can be configured via the parameters to this
method, all of which have default values. This behavior is convenient when working with ScalaTest in the Scala interpreter.
Here's a summary of this method's parameters and how you can use them:</p><p><strong>The <code>testName</code> parameter</strong></p><p>If you leave <code>testName</code> at its default value (of <code>null</code>), this method will pass <code>None</code> to
the <code>testName</code> parameter of <code>run</code>, and as a result all the tests in this suite will be executed. If you
specify a <code>testName</code>, this method will pass <code>Some(testName)</code> to <code>run</code>, and only that test
will be run. Thus to run all tests in a suite from the Scala interpreter, you can write:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; (new ExampleSuite).execute()
</pre></p><p>(The above syntax actually invokes the overloaded parameterless form of <code>execute</code>, which calls this form with its default parameter values.)
To run just the test named <code>"my favorite test"</code> in a suite from the Scala interpreter, you would write:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; (new ExampleSuite).execute("my favorite test")
</pre></p><p>Or:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; (new ExampleSuite).execute(testName = "my favorite test")
</pre></p><p><strong>The <code>configMap</code> parameter</strong></p><p>If you provide a value for the <code>configMap</code> parameter, this method will pass it to <code>run</code>. If not, the default value
of an empty <code>Map</code> will be passed. For more information on how to use a config map to configure your test suites, see
the <a href="#configMapSection">config map section</a> in the main documentation for this trait. Here's an example in which you configure
a run with the name of an input file:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; (new ExampleSuite).execute(configMap = Map("inputFileName" -&gt; "in.txt")
</pre></p><p><strong>The <code>color</code> parameter</strong></p><p>If you leave the <code>color</code> parameter unspecified, this method will configure the reporter it passes to <code>run</code> to print
to the standard output in color (via ansi escape characters). If you don't want color output, specify false for <code>color</code>, like this:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; (new ExampleSuite).execute(color = false)
</pre></p><p><strong>The <code>durations</code> parameter</strong></p><p>If you leave the <code>durations</code> parameter unspecified, this method will configure the reporter it passes to <code>run</code> to
<em>not</em> print durations for tests and suites to the standard output. If you want durations printed, specify true for <code>durations</code>,
like this:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; (new ExampleSuite).execute(durations = true)
</pre></p><p><strong>The <code>shortstacks</code> and <code>fullstacks</code> parameters</strong></p><p>If you leave both the <code>shortstacks</code> and <code>fullstacks</code> parameters unspecified, this method will configure the reporter
it passes to <code>run</code> to <em>not</em> print stack traces for failed tests if it has a stack depth that identifies the offending
line of test code. If you prefer a short stack trace (10 to 15 stack frames) to be printed with any test failure, specify true for
<code>shortstacks</code>:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; (new ExampleSuite).execute(shortstacks = true)
</pre></p><p>For full stack traces, set <code>fullstacks</code> to true:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; (new ExampleSuite).execute(fullstacks = true)
</pre></p><p>If you specify true for both <code>shortstacks</code> and <code>fullstacks</code>, you'll get full stack traces.</p><p><strong>The <code>stats</code> parameter</strong></p><p>If you leave the <code>stats</code> parameter unspecified, this method will <em>not</em> fire <code>RunStarting</code> and either <code>RunCompleted</code>
or <code>RunAborted</code> events to the reporter it passes to <code>run</code>.
If you specify true for <code>stats</code>, this method will fire the run events to the reporter, and the reporter will print the
expected test count before the run, and various statistics after, including the number of suites completed and number of tests that
succeeded, failed, were ignored or marked pending. Here's how you get the stats:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; (new ExampleSuite).execute(stats = true)
</pre></p><p>To summarize, this method will pass to <code>run</code>:</p><ul><li><code>testName</code> - <code>None</code> if this method's <code>testName</code> parameter is left at its default value of <code>null</code>, else <code>Some(testName)</code>.</li><li><code>reporter</code> - a reporter that prints to the standard output</li><li><code>stopper</code> - a <code>Stopper</code> whose <code>apply</code> method always returns <code>false</code></li><li><code>filter</code> - a <code>Filter</code> constructed with <code>None</code> for <code>tagsToInclude</code> and <code>Set()</code>
  for <code>tagsToExclude</code></li><li><code>configMap</code> - the <code>configMap</code> passed to this method</li><li><code>distributor</code> - <code>None</code></li><li><code>tracker</code> - a new <code>Tracker</code></li></ul><p>Note:  In ScalaTest, the terms &quot;execute&quot; and &quot;run&quot; basically mean the same thing and
can be used interchangably. The reason this method isn't named <code>run</code> is that it takes advantage of
default arguments, and you can't mix overloaded methods and default arguments in Scala. (If named <code>run</code>,
this method would have the same name but different arguments than the main <a href="#run"><code>run</code> method</a> that
takes seven arguments. Thus it would overload and couldn't be used with default argument values.)</p><p>Design note: This method has two &quot;features&quot; that may seem unidiomatic. First, the default value of <code>testName</code> is <code>null</code>.
Normally in Scala the type of <code>testName</code> would be <code>Option[String]</code> and the default value would
be <code>None</code>, as it is in this trait's <code>run</code> method. The <code>null</code> value is used here for two reasons. First, in
ScalaTest 1.5, <code>execute</code> was changed from four overloaded methods to one method with default values, taking advantage of
the default and named parameters feature introduced in Scala 2.8.
To not break existing source code, <code>testName</code> needed to have type <code>String</code>, as it did in two of the overloaded
<code>execute</code> methods prior to 1.5. The other reason is that <code>execute</code> has always been designed to be called primarily
from an interpeter environment, such as the Scala REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop). In an interpreter environment, minimizing keystrokes is king.
A <code>String</code> type with a <code>null</code> default value lets users type <code>suite.execute("my test name")</code> rather than
<code>suite.execute(Some("my test name"))</code>, saving several keystrokes.</p><p>The second non-idiomatic feature is that <code>shortstacks</code> and <code>fullstacks</code> are all lower case rather than
camel case. This is done to be consistent with the <a href="Shell.html"><code>Shell</code></a>, which also uses those forms. The reason
lower case is used in the <code>Shell</code> is to save keystrokes in an interpreter environment.  Most Unix commands, for
example, are all lower case, making them easier and quicker to type.  In the ScalaTest
<code>Shell</code>, methods like <code>shortstacks</code>, <code>fullstacks</code>, and <code>nostats</code>, <em>etc.</em>, are
designed to be all lower case so they feel more like shell commands than methods.</p></div><dl class="paramcmts block"><dt class="param">testName</dt><dd class="cmt"><p>the name of one test to run.</p></dd><dt class="param">configMap</dt><dd class="cmt"><p>a <code>Map</code> of key-value pairs that can be used by the executing <code>Suite</code> of tests.</p></dd><dt class="param">color</dt><dd class="cmt"><p>a boolean that configures whether output is printed in color</p></dd><dt class="param">durations</dt><dd class="cmt"><p>a boolean that configures whether test and suite durations are printed to the standard output</p></dd><dt class="param">shortstacks</dt><dd class="cmt"><p>a boolean that configures whether short stack traces should be printed for test failures</p></dd><dt class="param">fullstacks</dt><dd class="cmt"><p>a boolean that configures whether full stack traces should be printed for test failures</p></dd><dt class="param">stats</dt><dd class="cmt"><p>a boolean that configures whether test and suite statistics are printed to the standard output</p></dd></dl><dl class="attributes block"> <dt>Definition Classes</dt><dd><a href="Suite.html" class="extype" name="org.scalatest.Suite">Suite</a></dd><dt>Exceptions thrown</dt><dd><span class="cmt"><p><span class="extype" name="IllegalArgumentException"><code>IllegalArgumentException</code></span> if <code>testName</code> is defined, but no test with the specified test name

This method will register the test for later ignoring via an invocation of one of the <code>execute</code>
methods. This method exists to make it easy to ignore an existing test by changing the call to <code>it</code>
to <code>ignore</code> without deleting or commenting out the actual test code. The test will not be executed, but a
report will be sent that indicates the test was ignored. The name of the test will be a concatenation of the text of all surrounding describers,
from outside in, and the passed spec text, with one space placed between each item. (See the documenation

be thrown by the passed function value. The thrown exception must be an instance of the
type specified by the type parameter of this method. This method invokes the passed
function. If the function throws an exception that's an instance of the specified type,
this method returns that exception. Else, whether the passed function returns normally
or completes abruptly with a different exception, this method throws <code>TestFailedException</code>.</p><p>Note that the type specified as this method's type parameter may represent any subtype of
<code>AnyRef</code>, not just <code>Throwable</code> or one of its subclasses. In
Scala, exceptions can be caught based on traits they implement, so it may at times make sense
to specify a trait that the intercepted exception's class must mix in. If a class instance is
passed for a type that could not possibly be used to catch an exception (such as <code>String</code>,
for example), this method will complete abruptly with a <code>TestFailedException</code>.</p><p>Also note that the difference between this method and <code>assertThrows</code> is that this method
returns the expected exception, so it lets you perform further assertions on
that exception. By contrast, the <code>assertThrows</code> method returns <code>Succeeded</code>, which means it can
serve as the last statement in an async- or safe-style suite. <code>assertThrows</code> also indicates to the reader
of the code that nothing further is expected about the thrown exception other than its type.

The purpose of
pending tests is to facilitate a style of testing in which documentation of behavior is sketched
out before tests are written to verify that behavior (and often, the before the behavior of
the system being tested is itself implemented). Such sketches form a kind of specification of
what tests and functionality to implement later.</p><p>To support this style of testing, a test can be given a name that specifies one
bit of behavior required by the system being tested. The test can also include some code that
sends more information about the behavior to the reporter when the tests run. At the end of the test,
it can call method <code>pending</code>, which will cause it to complete abruptly with <code>TestPendingException</code>.
Because tests in ScalaTest can be designated as pending with <code>TestPendingException</code>, both the test name and any information
sent to the reporter when running the test can appear in the report of a test run. (In other words,
the code of a pending test is executed just like any other test.) However, because the test completes abruptly
with <code>TestPendingException</code>, the test will be reported as pending, to indicate
the actual test, and possibly the functionality it is intended to test, has not yet been implemented.</p><p>Note: This method always completes abruptly with a <code>TestPendingException</code>. Thus it always has a side
effect. Methods with side effects are usually invoked with parentheses, as in <code>pending()</code>. This
method is defined as a parameterless method, in flagrant contradiction to recommended Scala style, because it
forms a kind of DSL for pending tests. It enables tests in suites such as <code>FunSuite</code> or <code>FunSpec</code>
to be denoted by placing &quot;<code>(pending)</code>&quot; after the test name, as in:</p><p><pre class="stHighlighted">
test(<span class="stQuotedString">"that style rules are not laws"</span>) (pending)
</pre></p><p>Readers of the code see &quot;pending&quot; in parentheses, which looks like a little note attached to the test name to indicate
it is pending. Whereas &quot;<code>(pending())</code> looks more like a method call, &quot;<code>(pending)</code>&quot; lets readers
stay at a higher level, forgetting how it is implemented and just focusing on the intent of the programmer who wrote the code.</p></div><dl class="attributes block"> <dt>Definition Classes</dt><dd><a href="Assertions.html" class="extype" name="org.scalatest.Assertions">Assertions</a></dd></dl></div>

throw <code>TestFailedException</code>.</p><p>This method can be used to temporarily change a failing test into a pending test in such a way that it will
automatically turn back into a failing test once the problem originally causing the test to fail has been fixed.
At that point, you need only remove the <code>pendingUntilFixed</code> call. In other words, a
<code>pendingUntilFixed</code> surrounding a block of code that isn't broken is treated as a test failure.
The motivation for this behavior is to encourage people to remove <code>pendingUntilFixed</code> calls when
there are no longer needed.</p><p>This method facilitates a style of testing in which tests are written before the code they test. Sometimes you may
encounter a test failure that requires more functionality than you want to tackle without writing more tests. In this
case you can mark the bit of test code causing the failure with <code>pendingUntilFixed</code>. You can then write more
tests and functionality that eventually will get your production code to a point where the original test won't fail anymore.
At this point the code block marked with <code>pendingUntilFixed</code> will no longer throw an exception (because the
problem has been fixed). This will in turn cause <code>pendingUntilFixed</code> to throw <code>TestFailedException</code>
with a detail message explaining you need to go back and remove the <code>pendingUntilFixed</code> call as the problem orginally
causing your test code to fail has been fixed.</p></div><dl class="paramcmts block"><dt class="param">f</dt><dd class="cmt"><p>a block of code, which if it completes abruptly, should trigger a <code>TestPendingException</code></p></dd></dl><dl class="attributes block"> <dt>Definition Classes</dt><dd><a href="Assertions.html" class="extype" name="org.scalatest.Assertions">Assertions</a></dd><dt>Exceptions thrown</dt><dd><span class="cmt"><p><span class="extype" name="TestPendingException"><code>TestPendingException</code></span> if the passed block of code completes abruptly with an <code>Exception</code> or <code>AssertionError</code></p></span></dd></dl></div>

<code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> overrides <code>runTests</code>s. In a <code>Suite</code>
subclass that no longer invokes <code>runTests</code> from <code>run</code>, the

By making <code>runTests</code> final in such a <code>Suite</code> subtrait, you make
the attempt to mix <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> into a subclass of your subtrait
a compiler error. (It would fail to compile with a complaint that <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code>
is trying to override <code>runTests</code>, which is a final method in your trait.)</p></div><dl class="paramcmts block"><dt class="param">testName</dt><dd class="cmt"><p>an optional name of one test to run. If <code>None</code>, all relevant tests should be run.

implementation of this method returns the fully qualified name of this object's class.
Each suite reported during a run will commonly be an instance of a different <code>Suite</code> class,
and in such cases, this default implementation of this method will suffice. However, in special cases
you may need to override this method to ensure it is unique for each reported suite. For example, if you write
a <code>Suite</code> subclass that reads in a file whose name is passed to its constructor and dynamically
creates a suite of tests based on the information in that file, you will likely need to override this method
in your <code>Suite</code> subclass, perhaps by appending the pathname of the file to the fully qualified class name.
That way if you run a suite of tests based on a directory full of these files, you'll have unique suite IDs for
each reported suite.</p><p>The suite ID is <em>intended</em> to be unique, because ScalaTest does not enforce that it is unique. If it is not
unique, then you may not be able to uniquely identify a particular test of a particular suite. This ability is used,
for example, to dynamically tag tests as having failed in the previous run when rerunning only failed tests.</p></div><dl class="paramcmts block"><dt>returns</dt><dd class="cmt"><p>this <code>Suite</code> object's ID.</p></dd></dl><dl class="attributes block"> <dt>Definition Classes</dt><dd><a href="Suite.html" class="extype" name="org.scalatest.Suite">Suite</a></dd></dl></div>

matcher expressions. It is not intended to be used in regular test code. If you want to ensure that a bit of code throws an expected
exception, use <code>intercept</code>, not <code>trap</code>. Here's an example interpreter session without <code>trap</code>:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">

</pre></p><p>That's a pretty tall stack trace. Here's what it looks like when you use <code>trap</code>:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; trap { x shouldEqual 13 }
res1: Throwable = org.scalatest.exceptions.TestFailedException: 12 did not equal 13
</pre></p><p>Much less clutter. Bear in mind, however, that if <em>no</em> exception is thrown by the
passed block of code, the <code>trap</code> method will create a new <a href="Assertions$$NormalResult.html"><code>NormalResult</code></a>
(a subclass of <code>Throwable</code> made for this purpose only) and return that. If the result was the <code>Unit</code> value, it
will simply say that no exception was thrown:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; trap { x shouldEqual 12 }
res2: Throwable = No exception was thrown.
</pre></p><p>If the passed block of code results in a value other than <code>Unit</code>, the <code>NormalResult</code>'s <code>toString</code> will print the value:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; trap { "Dude!" }
res3: Throwable = No exception was thrown. Instead, result was: "Dude!"
</pre></p><p>Although you can access the result value from the <code>NormalResult</code>, its type is <code>Any</code> and therefore not
very convenient to use. It is not intended that <code>trap</code> be used in test code. The sole intended use case for <code>trap</code> is decluttering
Scala interpreter sessions by eliminating stack traces when executing assertion and matcher expressions.</p></div><dl class="attributes block"> <dt>Definition Classes</dt><dd><a href="Assertions.html" class="extype" name="org.scalatest.Assertions">Assertions</a></dd><dt>Annotations</dt><dd>
